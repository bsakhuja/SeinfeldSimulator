[Scene: Comedy club]

JERRY: You know, why we're here? [he means: here in the "Comedy club"] To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. [imitates one of these people "tryin' to find us"; pretends his hand is a phone] "Did you ring?, I can't find him." [imitates other person on phone] "Where did he go?" [the first person again] "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be getting back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.
 
[Scene: Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.]
JERRY: Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. [talking about George's shirt] The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.
GEORGE: Are you through? [kind of irritated]
JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?
GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.
JERRY: Oh, you don't recall?
GEORGE: [pretends he's talking into a microphone] Uh, no, not at this time.
JERRY: Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. [a waitress approaches the table]
WAITRESS: Mister Seinfeld. [she pours coffee in his cup] Mister Costanza. [she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her]
GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?
WAITRESS: It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. [ironically]
JERRY: Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.
WAITRESS: Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. [she pours the coffee and walks away]
GEORGE: How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?
JERRY: Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.
GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
GEORGE: No, you didn't!
JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what...
GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table] what is she like?
JERRY: Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.
GEORGE: [with a big smile] So, ya know, what, what happened?
JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great.
GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: This is great!
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.
GEORGE: [whistles disapproving] Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?
JERRY: Yeah, but...
GEORGE: "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?
JERRY: Yeah!
GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.
JERRY: [indignant] What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!
GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?
JERRY: Yes!
GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!
JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
GEORGE: [The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?
CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?
GEORGE: Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.
JERRY: [to George] Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?
GEORGE: [to Claire] Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to [makes some gestures to accent "has to"] come to New York on business...
JERRY: Oh you are beautiful! [ironically]
GEORGE: and, and maybe [again some gestures] she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
CLAIRE: I'd have to say: uuhh, no. [George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO]
GEORGE: [to Claire] So why did she call?
CLAIRE: To be polite.
GEORGE: To be polite, I rest my case.
JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me [stands up], I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
GEORGE: I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
JERRY: Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".
GEORGE: Come on, I'm tired.
CLAIRE: [to Jerry] Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.
GEORGE: [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics] Right, I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile]
 
[Scene: Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers]
GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. [walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry]
JERRY: Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.
GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...
JERRY: And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
GEORGE: What?!
JERRY: Laura.
GEORGE: I can't believe: [falls on his knees] WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
GEORGE: [gets up] 'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: What is that? It's ridiculous! [Jerry bobs agreeingly] You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers again] Signal!
JERRY: Maybe you're right.
GEORGE: Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.
JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
GEORGE: [puts an arm around Jerry and whispers] I know, I know. [normal voice] Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?
JERRY: No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.
GEORGE: You're gonna "overdry" it.
JERRY: You, you can't "overdry".
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: Same as you can't "overwet". [George looks puzzled] You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".
GEORGE: [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?
JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? [George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid]
GEORGE: [points to the dryer] Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle! [Jerry looks surprised]
 
[Scene: Comedy club]
JERRY: "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: [shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid]...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: [sock's voice] "Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road [shows how the sock is going down the road]. They got buttons sowed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first.
 
[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV]
JERRY: [The phone rings. He picks it up and says:] If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no [somebody knocks at the door] Yeah? [to the door, while still at the phone]
KRAMER: [enters] Are you up?
JERRY: [To Kramer] Yeah...[in the phone] Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem [hangs up the phone].
KRAMER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
JERRY: [upset] Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! [actually I can't understand the name; maybe "Kramer" wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!] I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
KRAMER: Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...[takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets] You got any meat?
JERRY: [a little irritated] Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! [Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in] Well what, what happened in the game anyway?
KRAMER: [still with his head in the refrigerator] What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! [takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.
JERRY: [cynical] Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!
KRAMER: Yeah. [Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look" and Kramer asks:] Are you done with this?
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
KRAMER: I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
JERRY: No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.
KRAMER: You want me to talk to her?
JERRY: I don't think so.
KRAMER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. [shows with his fingers how close it was]
JERRY: That close, huh?
KRAMER: You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it up]
JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
KRAMER: Give me it...let me talk to her [continues this way].
JERRY: [gestures Kramer to shut up] No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on TV]...
KRAMER: A SLIDE!...Wow!
JERRY: ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it [takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on] ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. [hangs up the phone; to Kramer:] I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!
 
[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress]
JERRY: If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.
GEORGE: Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? [sits down]
JERRY: [hands George a beer] Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.
GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?
JERRY: All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...
GEORGE: A decent hotel-room...
JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
GEORGE: You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? [waves with his handkerchief] This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
 
JERRY: [cynical] This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?
GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG [etc.]
KRAMER: [walks in behind the dog and closes the door] He really likes you, George.
GEORGE: [ironically] Well, that's flattering.
KRAMER: [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress on the floor] Is this for that girl?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Why even give her an option?
JERRY: This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on spring break".
GEORGE: Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.
JERRY: Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
GEORGE: So what? That's good.
JERRY: Now, how could that be good?
GEORGE: Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
JERRY: This is how you operate?
GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.
JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.
KRAMER: [stands up from the couch and yells.] WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable.
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: ...How's the real estate-business?
GEORGE:...[surprised he asked] It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.
KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
GEORGE: Well, I might be getting in to that.
KRAMER: [slaps George on the arm] You keep me posted!
GEORGE: I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom door], let's go! [Jerry and the dog come out] You're on stage in 25 minutes.
 
[Scene: Comedy club.]
JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: "I could use a cotton-ball right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss(?) bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?".
 
[Scene: Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura]
JERRY: Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?
GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.
JERRY: Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
GEORGE: Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
JERRY: Really? How?
GEORGE: 'Cause it's all in the greeting.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.
JERRY: Right.
GEORGE: Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.
JERRY: "Lip-area".
GEORGE: Ya know a hug: definitely good.
JERRY: Hug is definitely good.
GEORGE: Sure.
JERRY: Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
GEORGE: That's so brutal, I hate that.
JERRY: Ya know how they do that?
GEORGE: That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.
JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
GEORGE: Hand-sandwich.
JERRY: Right.
GEORGE: I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes]
LAURA: Guess who?
JERRY: Hey, hey.
LAURA and JERRY: Heeeey! [they take each others hands like they're planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled]
JERRY: It's good to see you.
LAURA: Hi.
JERRY: This is my friend George.
LAURA: [shakes George's hand] Hi, how nice to meet you.
GEORGE: Hi, how are you?
JERRY: This is Laura.
GEORGE: Laura, sure.
JERRY: [to Laura] I can't believe you're here.
GEORGE and JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. [they pick up the bags]
LAURA: Oh, thank you.
JERRY: [privately to George] Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
GEORGE: Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.
 
[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment]
JERRY: So uh, what do ya think?
LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.
JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. [Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
LAURA: [laughs] Actually uhm, do you have any wine?
JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.
LAURA: Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? [points to the lamp]
JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. [she turns down the lamp]
LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?
LAURA: No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.
JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?
LAURA: Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.
JERRY: [doubtfully] Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. [pours the wine] I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. [the phone rings; he picks it up] Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. [to Laura] Uhm, it's for you.
LAURA: [she takes the phone] Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye [she hangs up the phone]. Never get engaged.
JERRY: You're engaged?
LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.
JERRY: You're engaged? [still can't believe it]
LAURA: Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.
JERRY: You're engaged! [like he's answering his own question]
LAURA: Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...
JERRY: Yeah.
LAURA: You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.
JERRY: Me too!
 
[Scene: Comedy club.]
JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: [imitates horn]
e-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh, this man is out of ideas. How does it...? [imitates horn again] e-e-e-eeeehhhh, "I don't think she likes me"...The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't we. Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. "Where ever women are?", we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, OK, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene...That's why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: "Where to meet men?". We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve you better.

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why we’re here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about “We should go out”? This is what they’re talking about...this whole thing, we’re all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we’re all out! There are people tryin’ to find us, they don’t know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) “Did you ring?, I can’t find him.” “Where did he go?” “He didn’t tell me where he was going”. He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then you’re standing around, whatta you do? You go: “We gotta be getting back”. Once you’re out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it’s my feeling, you’ve gotta go.



INT. PETE’S LUNCHEONETTE – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a table, having coffee.)

JERRY: (pointing at George’s shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It’s too high! It’s in no-man’s-land. You look like you live with your mother.

GEORGE: Are you through? 

JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?

GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don’t actually recall considering the buttons.

JERRY: Oh, you don’t recall?

GEORGE: (on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.

JERRY: Well, senator, I’d just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.

(A waitress, Claire, approaches the table. She pours refills Jerry’s coffee.)

CLAIRE: Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza. 

(Claire tries to refill George’s coffee, but George blocks her.)

GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where’s the orange indicator?

CLAIRE: It’s missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it’s very challenging work.

JERRY: Can you relax, it’s a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.

CLAIRE: Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.

(Claire exits.)

GEORGE: How come you’re not doin’ the second show tomorrow?

JERRY: Well, there’s this uh, woman might be comin’ in.

GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?

JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?

GEORGE: No, you didn’t!

JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... 

GEORGE: Ha.

JERRY: (looks in the creamer) There’s no milk in here, what...

GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?

JERRY: Oh, she’s really great. I mean, she’s got like a real warmth about her and she’s really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.

GEORGE: (smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?

JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.

GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: This is great!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!

JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we’ll get together. 

GEORGE: (whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, ‘Had to’? ‘Had to’ come in?

JERRY: Yeah, but...

GEORGE: ‘Had to come in’ and ‘maybe we’ll get together’? ‘Had to’ and ‘maybe’?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. You’re not gonna see this woman.

JERRY: What, are you serious...why, why did she call?

GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 

JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!

GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn’t want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: You’re a back-up, you’re a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!

JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.

(Claire passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his notepad.)

GEORGE: Claire, Claire, you’re a woman, right?

CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?

GEORGE: Uhm...I’d like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.

JERRY (to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?

GEORGE: (to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? 

CLAIE: Uh huh.

GEORGE: She says she ‘has to’ come to New York on business...

JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!

GEORGE: ...and, and ‘maybe’ she’ll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?

CLAIRE: I’d have to say, uuhh, no. 

(George shows his note-block to Jerry; it says very largely: NO.)

GEORGE (to Claire) So why did she call?

CLAIRE: To be polite.

GEORGE: To be polite. I rest my case.

JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you’re talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.

GEORGE: I’m not gonna watch you do laundry.

JERRY: Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.

GEORGE: Come on, I’m tired.

CLAIRE: (to Jerry) Don’t worry, I gave him a little caffeine. He’ll perk up.

GEORGE: (panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!

(Claire exits, smiling.)



INT. LAUNDRAMAT - DAY

(Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers.)

GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment I’ve ever experienced. 

(George walks away from the dryer. A man passes by.)

JERRY: Well, look at this guy. Look, he’s got everything, he’s got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners. This is not his first load.

GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...

JERRY: And you didn’t even hear how she sounded.

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Laura.

GEORGE: I can’t believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!

JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?

GEORGE: ‘Cause it’s signals, Jerry, it’s signals! (snapping his fingers) Don’t you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin’ tomorrow night, if you were busy?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn’t make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It’s Saturday night!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What is that? It’s ridiculous! You don’t even know what hotel she’s staying at, you can’t call her. That’s a signal, Jerry, that’s a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!

JERRY: Maybe you’re right.

GEORGE: Maybe I’m right? Of course I’m right.

JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don’t even know where she’s staying! She, she’s not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.

(George puts his arm around Jerry.)

GEORGE: I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why don’t you just see if it’s dry?

JERRY: No no no, don’t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it’s doing. Just let it finish.

GEORGE: You’re gonna overdry it.

JERRY: You, you can’t overdry.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: Same as you can’t overwet. You see, once something is wet, it’s wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you’re dead, right? Let’s say you drop dead and I shoot you. You’re not gonna die again, you’re already dead. You can’t overdie, you can’t overdry.

GEORGE: (to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?

JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? 

(George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it. The dryer stops working and he closes the lid.)

GEORGE: Look at that. They’re done! 



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, peforming.)

JERRY: Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y’know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it’s dark, there’s bubbles happening, they’re all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, “C’mon babe, let’s go”. You come by, you open up the lid and they’ll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they’re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, “Tomorrow, the dryer, I’m goin’. You wait here!” The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you don’t see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So they’re showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first. 



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is on the couch, watching TV. The phone rings. He picks up the reciever.)

JERRY: (answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, don’t say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no 

(There’s a knock at the door.)

JERRY: (to the door) Yeah?

(Kessler enters.)

KESSLER: Are you up?

JERRY: (to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.

(Jerry hangs up.)

KESSLER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? 

JERRY: (upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, it’s a tape! I taped the game, it’s one o’clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.

KESSLER: Hey, I’m sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets, and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat?

JERRY: Meat? I don’t, I don’t know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?

KESSLER: (from the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that’s what happened!

(He takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it.)

KESSLER: You know, I almost wound up going to that game.

JERRY: (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven’t been out of the building in ten years!

KESSLER: Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, “Do you mind?”) Are you done with this?

JERRY: No.

(Kessler glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table.)

KESSLER: When you’re done, let me know.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.

KESSLER: I thought I wasn’t allowed to be in here this weekend.

JERRY: No, it’s okay now, that, that girl is not comin’. Uh, I misread the whole thing.

KESSLER: You want me to talk to her?

JERRY: I don’t think so.

KESSLER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.

(Kessler shows with his fingers how close he was.)

JERRY: That close, huh?

KESSLER: You better believe it.

(The phone rings. Jerry picks it up.)

JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.

KESSLER: Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.

JERRY: (to the phone) No believe me, I’m always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...

KESSLER: (to the TV) SLIDE! Wow!

JERRY: No, it’s, it’s just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, don’t be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it’s no trouble at all... I’ll see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I don’t believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! 



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry and George enter, carrying a heavy mattress.)

JERRY: If my father was moving this he’d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your end’s got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end’s got to come down.'

GEORGE: You know, I can’t believe you’re bringin’ in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why don’t you bring in an extra guy too?

(George takes a seat. Jerry hands him a beer.)

JERRY: Look, it’s a very awkward situation. I don’t wanna be presumptuous.

GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?

JERRY: All right, she said she couldn’t find a decent hotel room...

GEORGE: A decent hotel-room...

JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.

GEORGE: You can’t be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal! 

JERRY: (cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?

GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. 

(Suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George on the couch.)

GEORGE: Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...

(Kessler enters and closes the door.)

KESSLER: Hey, he really likes you, George.

GEORGE: Well, that’s flattering. 

(The dog heads for the bathroom and starts drinking from the toilet.)

KESSLER: Oh, he’s gettin’ a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl?

JERRY: Yeah.

KESSLER: Why even give her an option?

JERRY: This is a person I like, it’s not “How to score on spring break”.

GEORGE: Right, can we go? ‘Cause I’m double-parked, I’m gonna get a ticket.

JERRY: Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.

GEORGE: So what? That’s good.

JERRY: Now, how could that be good?

GEORGE: Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin’ around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin’ over, “I’ve gotta tidy up?” Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.

JERRY: This is how you operate?

GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.

JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.

KESSLER: Why even give her an option for? 

(Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door.)

KESSLER: (to George, pointing at the mattress) It’s unbelievable.

GEORGE: Yeah.

KESSLER: How’s the real estate-business?

GEORGE: (feeling awkward) It’s uh, not bad, it’s comin’ along. Why? Did you need something.

KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?

GEORGE: Well, I might be getting into that.

KESSLER: (slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!

GEORGE: I’m aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, let’s go (opens the bathroom door) Let’s go!

(Jerry and the dog come out.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

(Jerry on stage; performing)

JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it’s a pressure world, it’s a world of tension, it’s a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, ‘cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don’t know what they need. I know I don’t have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I’m- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we’re all human beings, what is the story? I’ve never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I’ve never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: “I could use a cotton-ball right now.” I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they don’t need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they’re like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They’re huge and two days later, they’re out, they’re gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin’ with them? The only time I ever see ‘em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there’s two or three, that look like they’ve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don’t know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl who’s left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I don’t know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. “Let’s move on.” The dating world is a world of pressure. Let’s face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you’ll end up naked at the end of it. You know? “Well, Bill, the boss thinks you’re the man for the position, why don’t you strip down and meet some of the people you’ll be workin’ with?” 



INT. AIRPORT – NIGHT

(Jerry and George are waiting for Laura.)

JERRY: Wouldn’t it be great if you could ask a woman what she’s thinking?

GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she’s thinkin’.

JERRY: You know, instead, I’m like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.

GEORGE: Listen, listen, don’t get worked up, ‘cause you’re gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.

JERRY: Really? How?

GEORGE: ‘Cause it’s all in the greeting. 

JERRY: Uh-huh.

GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that’s a good sign.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.

JERRY: Lip area.

GEORGE: You know a hug: definitely good.

JERRY: Hug is definitely good.

GEORGE: Sure.

JERRY: Although what if it’s one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?

GEORGE: That’s so brutal, I hate that.

JERRY: You know how they do that?

GEORGE: That’s why, you know, a shake is bad.

JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it’s the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?

GEORGE: Hand sandwich.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: I see, well, that’s open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. 

(A woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry’s eyes.)

LAURA: Guess who?

JERRY: Hey, hey.

LAURA & JERRY: Heeeey!

(They take each others hands and shake them around. George is looking puzzled.)

JERRY: It’s good to see you.

LAURA: Hi.

JERRY: This is my friend George.

LAURA: Hi, how nice to meet you.

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

JERRY: This is Laura.

GEORGE: Laura, sure.

JERRY: (to Laura) I can’t believe you’re here.

GEORGE & JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. 

(They pick up the bags.)

LAURA: Oh, thank you.

JERRY: (aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?

GEORGE: Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasn’t in the manual, I don’t know.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is in the midst of showing Laura the apartment.)

JERRY: So uh, what do you think?

LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn’t so bad.

JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?

LAURA: (laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do.

LAURA: (referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?

JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.

(She turns down the lamp.)

LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible – and if it’s not, fine – for me to stay here tomorrow night too?

(Jerry takes off his shoes to make himself comfortable)

JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin’ anything?

LAURA: No, I’d love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I’m right open.

JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?

LAURA: Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but I’d just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.

JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) I’m just, I’m really glad you’re here.

(The phone rings; he picks it up.)

JERRY: (answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, it’s for you.

LAURA: (to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, I’m gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it’s fine... No, we’re goin’ on a boat ride... Don’t be silly... I’m not gonna have this conversation... Look, I’ll call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged.

JERRY: (not excited) You’re engaged?

LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it’s like until you actually do it. And I’m on this emotional roller coaster.

JERRY: You’re engaged? 

LAURA: You know, I can’t believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of “we”. Ugh, it’s a very stressful situation.

JERRY: (matter-of-factly) You’re engaged. 

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, he’s a great guy...

JERRY: Yeah.

LAURA: You’d really like him, you know, I can’t wait to get on that boat.

JERRY: Me too!



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don’t get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I’m not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they’re so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that’s it! It’s the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don’t know ‘bout that, we don’t know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we’ve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! “I don’t think she likes me.” The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don’t we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That’s why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: “Where to meet men?” We’re here, we are everywhere. We’re honking our horns to serve you better.

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...

(He pauses and gestures to audience for response.)
AUDIENCE: Cheque.

JERRY: Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry “draws” imaginary book from a holster.) “Who do I make it out to? There’s my ID.” There’s something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don’t know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, “I don’t have any money, but if you’ll contact these people, I’m sure they’ll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I don’t have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?”



INT. VIDEO STORE – NIGHT

(Jerry and Elaine are picking out a movie for the night.)
JERRY: What’s that one?

ELAINE: “Coccoon II: The Return”. I guess they didn’t like it up there.

JERRY: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y’know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she’s probably screamin’ at those aliens, “I gotta have a lo mein!”

ELAINE: Okay, what’re we doing here? I have seen everything.

JERRY: Oh yeah? I don’t believe you’ve seen... this.

(Jerry shows Elaine a movie from the Adult section.)

ELAINE: Oh, lovely.

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: What do you think their parents think?

JERRY: “So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?” “Oh, he’s a public fornicator. Yes, he’s a fine boy...”

ELAINE: Y’know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela’s birthday.

JERRY: Pamela? Do I know her?

ELAINE: Yeah, you met her when we were going out.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right...

ELAINE: You have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?

JERRY: (quickly) No.

ELAINE: Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?

JERRY: (a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.

ELAINE: Right! In fact... No, never mind...

JERRY: Well, what is it?

ELAINE: Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you don’t want to go to... that... no.

JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.

ELAINE: What little deal?

JERRY: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.

ELAINE: A wedding? Have you lost it, man?

JERRY: Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...

ELAINE: They’re coming in?

JERRY: Yeah, tomorrow.

ELAINE: Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?

JERRY: No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.

ELAINE: Why does he do that?

JERRY: Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?

ELAINE: A wedding?

JERRY: There’s a lot of people to mock...

ELAINE: All right, what the hell.

JERRY: Great!

WOMAN: When you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. You’re not goin’ anywhere...



INT. BAR – NIGHT

(Elaine and Jerry enter.)

ELAINE: C’mon lets go...

JERRY: Was I supposed to bring something?

ELAINE: You could have.

JERRY: I met her one time...

ELAINE: It is not necessary.

JERRY: What did you say then?

ELAINE: Sssshhhhhh!!!

PAMELA: Hi

ELAINE: Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.

PAMELA: (shakes Jerry's hand) Yes, we met.

JERRY: Hi, happy birthday.

PAMELA: Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.

GUESTS, JERRY & ELAINE: Hi

JERRY: I didn’t bring anything.

PAMELA: Uh, I put you two right here.

JERRY: Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to bring, nobody told me.

(Jerry and Elaine sit next to each other at a table. Across from Jerry is a strikingly beautiful woman, Vanessa. The piano is playing awful dinner music.)

VANESSA: How big a tip do you think it’d take to get him to stop?

JERRY: I’m in for five...

VANESSA: I’ll supply the hat.

JERRY: (thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?

VANESSA: Why don’t you relax and take your jacket off?

JERRY: Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.

VANESSA: How masculine.

JERRY: Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) She’s unbelievable!

(The guy beside Vanessa interrupts.)

ROGER: (to Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker.

VANESSA: Oh, you know Bricker! From where?

JERRY: (thinking) What’s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she’s too good to be alone. What’s the difference, I can’t maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.

VANESSA: (to Jerry) How do you know Pamela?

JERRY: Uh, friend of a friend. And you?

VANESSA: We went to law school together.

ELAINE: (interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!

JERRY: (turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.

ELAINE: I had this dream last night and you were in it.

JERRY: Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.

ELAINE: You were you, but, you weren’t you...

JERRY: No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!

ELAINE: I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...

JERRY: (thinking) This is brutal.

ELAINE: You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.

JERRY: How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can’t, I can’t. I’m stuck.

ELAINE: (noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?

JERRY: Yes, I heard you.

PAMELA: Elaine, what’s the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?

JERRY: (thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, you’re a lawyer...

VANESSA: Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

JERRY: (thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.

VANESSA: Oh, that was you?

JERRY: Imagine, spelling “Mom” with two O’s.

VANESSA: Very funny! What do you do?

JERRY: Comedian.

VANESSA: Really? That explains it.

JERRY: (thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

ROGER: Are you ready?

VANESSA: We gotta run. Happy birthday!

(Vanessa and Roger get up an leave. Jerry panics.)

JERRY: (thinking) I can’t believe it. I got nothing! I don’t even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...

(A grim stare from Elaine knocks his concentration.)



INT. TAXICAB – NIGHT

(On the ride home from the party. Jerry and Elaine sit in the back seat.)

JERRY: That wasn’t so bad, really.

ELAINE: Y’know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.

JERRY: Why? What did I do?

ELAINE: Wel-Well, I just don’t appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I’m selling you aluminum siding.

JERRY: I was listening!

ELAINE: No! You couldn’t wait to get back to your little... “conversation”.

JERRY: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.

ELAINE: Uh-huh...

JERRY: Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.

ELAINE: No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn’t have wooden teeth, you did!

JERRY: All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?

ELAINE: So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin’ it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don’t do anything, and go right home. What’d you think? I think it’s going to be big!” I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn’t work. Y’know, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, “Uh, Hi, uh my name’s Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it’s a Riconic relationship.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry’s parents, Helen and Morty, are sitting on a pullout couch. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: Hey!

MORTY: Ah, there he is!

JERRY: This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!

HELEN: Y’know, Jerry, we don’t have to do this.

JERRY: What are you talkin’ about? It’s fine, I love having you here.

HELEN: Tomorrow we’ll go to a hotel.

JERRY: Ma, will you stop?

HELEN: No, why should we take over your apartment?

JERRY: I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.

HELEN: Your friend Kramer doesn’t mind?

JERRY: No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.

JERRY: So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?

MORTY: Depends on the firm.

JERRY: Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?

MORTY: What’s the matter? You need a lawyer?

JERRY: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.

MORTY: So why don’t you ask someone who was at the party?

JERRY: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.

HELEN: Why not?

JERRY: Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.

HELEN: He used to go with her.

HELEN: Which one is she?

MORTY: From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn’t like.

HELEN: Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.

JERRY: Oh yeah, she’s great.

HELEN: So, how come nothing materialized there?

JERRY: Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...

HELEN: I know what it was.

JERRY: You don’t know what it was.

HELEN: So, what was it?

JERRY: Well, we fight a lot for some reason.

HELEN & MORTY: Oh, well...

JERRY: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.

(His parents don’t know how to respond.)

HELEN: Well, I think she’s a very attractive girl.

JERRY: Oh, she is, she absolutely is.

HELEN: I can see if there was a weight problem...

JERRY: No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.

HELEN: You know, you can’t be so particular. Nobody’s perfect.

JERRY: I know, I know...

MORTY: Y’know Jerry, it’s a good thing I wasn’t so particular.

HELEN: (hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So who’re you looking for, Sophia Loren?

JERRY: That’s got nothin’ to do with it.

MORTY: How about Loni Anderson?

HELEN: Where do you get Loni Anderson?

MORTY: Why, what’s wrong with Loni Anderson?

HELEN: I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.

JERRY: What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn’t the one.

HELEN: And this other one’s the one?

JERRY: I dunno, maybe...

MORTY: So ask Elaine there for her number.

JERRY: I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.

HELEN: How could you still see her if your not interested?

JERRY: We’re friends.

MORTY: Doesn’t sound like you’re friends to me. If you were friends you'd-you’d ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?

JERRY: Oh yeah.

MORTY: Well, go up to the office.

HELEN: Up to her office?

MORTY: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn’t she?

JERRY: I guess.

MORTY: So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.

JERRY: You mean stakeout the lobby?

HELEN: Morty, that’s ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!

MORTY: He doesn’t want to ask Elaine for the number.

HELEN: So you’ve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?

MORTY: He pretends he bumped into her!

JERRY: Y’know what? This is not that bad an idea.



INT. OFFICE BUILDING – DAY

(Jerry and George are staking out Vanessa.)

GEORGE: What does she look like?

JERRY: I dunno. Hard to say.

GEORGE: What actress does she remind you of?

JERRY: Loni Anderson.

GEORGE: Loni Anderson?!

JERRY: What, there’s something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.

GEORGE: Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)

JERRY: I’m a little nervous.

GEORGE: Yeah, me too...

JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that I’m doing here in the building?

GEORGE: You came to see me. I work in the building.

JERRY: What do you do?

GEORGE: I’m an architect.

JERRY: You’re an architect?

GEORGE: I’m not?

JERRY: I don’t see architecture comin from you.

GEORGE: (somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.

JERRY: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin’ else.

GEORGE: All right, she’s not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.

JERRY: Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?

GEORGE: We’re having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.

JERRY: What is his name?

GEORGE: Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.

JERRY: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.

GEORGE: No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....

JERRY: Art Cor...

GEORGE: ...velay.

JERRY: Corvelay?

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Well, what does he do?

GEORGE: He’s an importer.

JERRY: Just imports, no exports?

GEORGE: (annoyed) He’s an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?

JERRY: No, I guess she’s still mad.

GEORGE: I don’t understand, you never talk to her about other women?

JERRY: Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. That’s her. On the right.

GEORGE: (anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!

JERRY: You’re you. We’re having lunch with Art Corvelay.

GEORGE: Vandelay!

JERRY: Corvelay!

GEORGE: Let me be the architect! I can do it!

(Jerry ignores George and approaches Vanessa.)

JERRY: Hey, hey. uh Pamela’s birthday party, didn’t I see you there? Jerry.

VANESSA: Sure! Hi!

JERRY: Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) I’m sorry...

VANESSA: Vanessa.

GEORGE: Nice to meet you.

JERRY: Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

VANESSA: That’s right! Yea, what’re you doing here?

JERRY: Oh, we’re meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.

GEORGE: Yeah, Art Vandelay.

VANESSA: Really? Which company?

JERRY & George: (turning to each other) I don’t know. He’s an importer.

VANESSA: Importer?

GEORGE: ...And exporter.

JERRY: He’s an importer/exporter.

GEORGE: (clears his throat) I’m, uh, I’m an architect.

VANESSA: Really. What do you design?

GEORGE: Uh, railroads, uh...

VANESSA: I thought engineers do that.

GEORGE: They can...

JERRY: Y’know I’m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.

VANESSA: Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.

JERRY: Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)

VANESSA: Yeah, and that woman was your...

JERRY: Friend!

GEORGE: I’ll just, uh, get a paper...

JERRY: So, um, do you date uh immature men?

VANESSA: Almost exclusively...



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Helen and Jerry are in the middle of a game of Scrabble. Morty sits on the couch. Helen sings to herself while she tries to form a word.)

HELEN: Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...

JERRY: (annoyed) Ma, will you go already?

HELEN: Bum bum bum bum...

(She picks up a nearby dictionary.)

JERRY: What are you doing?!

HELEN: Wait, I just want to see something.

JERRY: You can’t look in there, we’re playing!

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

MORTY: (cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?

JERRY: Look.

HELEN: “Quo”. Is that a word?

JERRY: Maybe!

HELEN: Will you challenge it?

JERRY: Ma, you can’t look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, she’s cheating!

KRAMER: “Quo”? That’s not a word.

HELEN: (to Jerry) You’re such a stickler...

JERRY: Well put something down, you’re taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they’re all coming over here before the wedding?

HELEN: They’ll be here at two o’clock. Oh, Elaine called. She said she’d be here at two-thirty. And she says “Hope your meeting went well with ‘Art Vandelay’?”

JERRY: She said what?

HELEN: Just what I said, here.

(She hands Jerry the note. He reads it.)

JERRY: She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.

HELEN: She knows what?

JERRY: She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...

(Kramer arranges Mrs. Seinfeld’s tiles, offering her a word.)

HELEN: No, no, no, that won’t do. He may have a “Z”.

MORTY: So, how did she find out?

JERRY: Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.

(While they talk, Kramer has covertly scoped Jerry’s tiles to confirm that Jerry doesn’t have a “Z”. This goes unnoticed by Jerry, who continues to talk with Morty.)

MORTY: So, what are you? Afraid of her?

JERRY: Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?

HELEN: Whatever I wrote down.

JERRY: Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?

HELEN: Who am I, Rich Little?

MORTY: Well, she can’t be too mad. She’s still coming to the wedding.

JERRY: Yeah, but now I’m nervous.

HELEN: Oh, stop it.

(She makes her move and tallies the points.)

JERRY: “Quone”?

HELEN: ...30...31...

JERRY: “Quone”? No, I’m afraid that I’m going to have to challenge that.

(Jerry picks up the dictionary.)

HELEN: ...32...

KRAMER: No, you don’t have to challenge that. That’s a word. That’s a definite word.

JERRY: I am challenging.

KRAMER: Quone. To quone something.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

(Jerry looks up the word.)

HELEN: I’m not playing with you anymore.

MORTY: Quone’s not a word.

JERRY: No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.

HELEN: (to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?

KRAMER: Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY

(A few people mingling about, waiting to go to the wedding. [SeinPurgatory] Jerry is talking to Carol.)

CAROL: You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now that’s a sitcom!

JERRY: You must have quite a time down there.

(Jerry checks his watch.)

CAROL: We got plenty of time.

JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m just waiting for someone.

UNCLE MAC: Watch what you say to this guy. He’ll put it in his next act!

(Carol and Uncle Mac laugh)

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...

UNCLE MAC: Jerry, did I tell you that I’m writing a book? An autobiography.

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.

UNCLE MAC: It’s based on all my experiences!

JERRY: That’s perfect.

(Elaine enters.)

JERRY: Could you excuse me one second? I’m sorry.

(Jerry goes over and greets Elaine.)

JERRY: How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.

ELAINE: Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.

(Awkward sighs from Jerry and Elaine)

JERRY: Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?

ELAINE: Oh no, let’s do it now.

JERRY: All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-

ELAINE: Okay.

ARTIE: Jerry, were you goin’ with us?

JERRY: No, I’m gonna take my car.

ARTIE: That’s why I brought the wagon. Why the hell did I bring the wagon?

JERRY: Anyway, you know why I didn’t ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.

ELAINE: Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.

CAROL: Jerry, we’ll see you there. Bye, Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh, bye. Good to see you.

ARTIE: Oh, we didn’t meet.

JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.

(Jerry pronounces the name ‘le-VEEN’.)

ARTIE: (correcting Jerry) Levine.

(Artie pronounces it with a long “I”. Artie exits.)

JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.

ELAINE: Yeah, obviously.

JERRY: I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.

ELAINE: Couldn’t agree more.

JERRY: Good.

ELAINE: Good.

JERRY: Good.

ELAINE: Great!

JERRY: Great? Where do you get ‘great’?

ELAINE: It’s great to... talk about... other people...

JERRY: ...Guys?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?

ELAINE: No. A general guy.

JERRY: Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...

ELAINE: What? No, it’s not a big deal.

JERRY: No, that’s great! That’s terrific!

ELAINE: No, we just met...

JERRY: Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? I would like to meet him.

ELAINE: Hmmm, I don’t think so.

JERRY: Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?

ELAINE: Wall street.

JERRY: Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.

ELAINE: And he happens to be pretty good lookin’.

JERRY: (pause) All right, sir.

ELAINE: And... he’s hilarious.

JERRY: Now that’s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?

ELAINE: I staked out his health club.

JERRY: Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?

(They leave his apartment)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

Jerry is on stage, performing.

JERRY: Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? It’s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It’s like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, “Look, a rabbit.” The other goes, “So? I believe this is your card.” “Look, why don’t we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?”

INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It’s a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I’m supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it’s supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn’t you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. ‘Cause it’s not easy to give someone the toe, you’ve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) “Look at that toe, buddy.” (He puts his foot down.) I mean, that’s really insulting to get the toe, isn’t it?



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT 

(Jerry is packing a suitcase. Elaine is sitting at the table, watching him.)

JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) That’s it. Done!

ELAINE: (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.

JERRY: (proudly) I am...the master packer.

ELAINE: (laughs) Yeah, right, you’re the master packer.

JERRY: What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) You’ve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.

ELAINE: (raising her hand) ‘Scuse me, master packer...

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Just gimme your keys.

JERRY: All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?

GEORGE: (from the intercom) Yeah.

(Jerry presses the second button, and opens the apartment door.)

ELAINE: Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.

ELAINE: Okay, this is quite a place.

JERRY: There’s more. The refrigerator.

(Jerry opens the fridge.)

JERRY: Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?

ELAINE: I’ll eat out.

JERRY: One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.

(George enters.)

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Ready?

JERRY: Yeah, one sec.

(George closes the door.)

GEORGE: Hey, Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Coming to the airport with us?

ELAINE: No, I’m staying here for the weekend. I’m getting a break from my roommate.

GEORGE: Oh, the actress-waitress?

ELAINE: No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of “A Chorus Line”. So, now all day long she’s walking around the apartment singing, “God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it!” She’s gonna get it right in her...

GEORGE: So just kick her out.

ELAINE: She’s on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.

JERRY: I’m not looking.

GEORGE: No no no, this one’s different. This one’s a beauty!

JERRY: Yeah, what’s it like?

GEORGE: I haven’t seen it yet, but it’s a two-bedroom, it’s on the uh, west 83rd, ‘bout a half block from the park?

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: Uh, twice what you’re payin’ here, but it’s a great building. It’s two bedrooms!

JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerry’s back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.

ELAINE: You oughta at least take a look at it.

JERRY: Really? Why?

ELAINE: ‘Cause then I could move in here.

JERRY: Ohhhh...

ELAINE: It’s time you got outta here anyway.

GEORGE: Yeah, tell ‘im. But quickly, I’m double parked here.

ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can’t have soft cheese...

GEORGE: Let’s not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.

ELAINE: Jerry, come on, you’re doin’ okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn’t have to live like this.

JERRY: Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.

ELAINE: Well, for me it’s a step up. It’s like moving from Iceland to Finland.

GEORGE: Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?

JERRY: I can’t think about it now. Come on, I’m going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
 


INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry enters his apartment with his bags.)

JERRY: Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!

ELAINE: (from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?

JERRY: Great, I had fun. Where’s the TV, where’s the VCR?

(Elaine has a guilty look on her face.)

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: They were stolen.

JERRY: Stolen? When?

ELAINE: A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.

JERRY: Stolen?

(Kramer enters the apartment.)

ELAINE: (looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.

(Elaine enters the bathroom.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) You left the door open?!

KRAMER: Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin’ and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, ‘cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!

JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?

KRAMER: (guiltily) The door.

JERRY: The door? You left the door open?

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.

JERRY: Yeah, and?

KRAMER: Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. “The Bold And The Beautiful”.

JERRY: So the door was wide open?

KRAMER: Wide open!

(Elaine enters the living room.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) And where were you?

ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdale’s... waiting for the shower to heat up.

KRAMER: Look, Jerry, I’m sorry, I’m uh- you have insurance, right buddy?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: (shocked) How can you not have insurance?

JERRY: Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It’s the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!

KRAMER: Jerry! I’m gonna find your stuff. I’m gonna solve it, I’m on the case, buddy, I’m on the case.

JERRY: Yeah, don’t investigate, don’t pay me back, it was an accident.

KRAMER: (theatrical) I made a mistake.

ELAINE: These things happen.

KRAMER: I’m human.

JERRY: In your way.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(A policeman is filling out a report. Jerry and Elaine are there.)

POLICEMAN: Let’s see, that’s, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that ‘bout it?

ELAINE: Answering machine.

JERRY: (disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.

POLICEMAN: What do you mean?

JERRY: It’s a joke.

POLICEMAN: I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we’ll look into it and uh, we’ll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything.

JERRY: You ever find anything?

POLICEMAN: No.

(Policeman hands Jerry his copy of the report.)

JERRY: Well, thanks anyway.

POLICEMAN: You bet.

(Policeman leaves the apartment, while George enters.)

ELAINE: I didn’t get that joke either.

JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages aren’t for him. He’s the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?

(George slaps his right hand on his left elbow, and vice versa, acting like a genie.)

GEORGE : I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.

JERRY: Again?

GEORGE: I don’t know how you put up with this.

ELAINE: Yeah, tell ‘im George.

JERRY: (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?

ELAINE: Yes! You don’t understand. I’m living with Ethel Merman without the talent.

JERRY: (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?

(George shows him the keys.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it’s very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, “Call the police. You really should call the police.” So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, “Yeah, I’m calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I’m gonna see some real action.” Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don’t really think we’re gonna crack this case, do you? It’s not like Batman, where there’s three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. “Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, he’s dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, he’s a PENGUIN!



INT. THE APARTMENT ON 83RD STREET – DAY

(George, Elaine and Jerry are entering the apartment.)

ELAINE: Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?

(Elaine takes a closer look at the fireplace.)

GEORGE: I didn’t know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.

JERRY: How do you get all that wood in here?

ELAINE: They deliver it.

JERRY: They deliver wood?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: What do you tip a wood guy?

(George looks intensively at the apartment description.)

GEORGE: I didn’t know there was a fireplace.

ELAINE: Look! Look at- look at this! There’s a garden.

GEORGE: A garden! I can’t believe there’s a garden!

JERRY: Would I have to get a gardener?

ELAINE: Yeah, you can get a gardener.

JERRY: You tip him?

ELAINE: You can.

GEORGE: (to Elaine) You don’t tip a gardener!

ELAINE: You can tip a gardener.

GEORGE: You don’t need a gardener.

ELAINE: Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

JERRY: They deliver the coal?

ELAINE: Sure, it’s...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.

JERRY: Oh, then I gotta tip him.

ELAINE: Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!

JERRY: I don’t have any plants.

GEORGE: I have plants. (snorts)

ELAINE: Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I’m walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) It’s a walk-in. Can you believe it? I’m nuts about this, what do you think?

(Jerry closes the door, with Elaine still in it.)

JERRY: I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?

GEORGE: It’s your decision.

(Jerry walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying his every move. Suddenly Jerry stops walking. Elaine is not able to copy this move; they look at each other, laughing.)

JERRY: I’m takin’ it, I’m takin’ the place. I’m gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I’m livin’ here...I’m movin’.

ELAINE: (laughing with joy) Your movin’? That means I’m movin’. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isn’t that incredible!

GEORGE: (unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
 


INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are there.)

ELAINE: What about the couch?

JERRY: You like the couch? I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: You’re movin’ in, you’re a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don’t even wanna see it, go, get it out.

ELAINE: A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?

JERRY: Yeah!

ELAINE: For this couch?!

(Jerry shuts the apartment door.)

JERRY: Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?

ELAINE: Okay, uh, I’ll tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I don’t know, maybe...twenty dollars?

(Jerry looks at her as if to say, “You can’t be serious.” The apartment buzzer goes off. Jerry speaks over the intercom.)

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: (from the intercom) Yeah, it’s George.

JERRY: Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, I’m gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) I’m just gonna pack up the cushions right now...

ELAINE: Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.

JERRY: (continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, ‘cause I wanna get it in the hall.

(He is about to lift up the couch.)

ELAINE: Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?

JERRY: Fifty dollars?

ELAINE: Uh-huh.

JERRY: Thank you very much.

ELAINE: Thank you very much.

(George enters and closes the door.)

GEORGE: Hey, what’s goin’ on?

ELAINE: I just bought Jerry’s couch for fifty dollars.

JERRY: (to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.

GEORGE: (frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: If you’re having second thoughts, if you didn’t want it, don’t worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.

JERRY: You could take it? You want it?

GEORGE: No, I don’t want it. I want it, if you don’t want it.

JERRY: So you do want it.

GEORGE: No I, I want it if you don’t want it.

JERRY: You just said you wanted it!

GEORGE: No, I’m saying, if a situation arose in which you didn’t want it, I might take it.

(Jerry picks up the lease and hands it to George.)

JERRY: So take it.

GEORGE: How can I take it?

JERRY: How can I take it?

GEORGE: It’s your apartment!

JERRY: How can I want it now, if you want it?

ELAINE: Excuse me, uh, I don’t mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?

GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it.

JERRY: I...am not taking it.

(He drops the lease demonstratively on his line.)

ELAINE: Well, one of you better damn well take it!

JERRY: Well, whaddaya wanna do here?

GEORGE: I, I don’t know.

JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin?

GEORGE: Who flips? You’ll flip, I’ll call.

JERRY: Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that’s it. Agreed?

GEORGE: I’m good.

ELAINE: I don’t know, who to root for, George’s place has carpeting.

(George "shushes" Elaine)

JERRY: All right, now you call it in the air.

GEORGE: No catchin’.

JERRY: No no.

GEORGE: Flip it.

(Jerry flips the coin.)

GEORGE: Heads!

(The coin hits the table. It falls on the floor. They all look intently at the coin.)

JERRY: Tails!

GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table.

JERRY: So what?

GEORGE: Interference! You can’t count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.

JERRY: You didn’t call no interference!

GEORGE: You don’t have to call that! That’s a rule!

JERRY: I don’t believe this.

GEORGE: Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!

JERRY: I don’t wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?

ELAINE: I’d better not.

JERRY: Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that’s it, you gotta win three.

GEORGE: Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. I’ll choose you. Whaddaya want?

JERRY: Odds.

GEORGE: I want evens.

JERRY: Good.

GEORGE: You got odds.

JERRY: You got evens.

GEORGE: Right, ready?

JERRY: For the apartment.

(They take their choose positions.)

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

(George walks to the table to take a break. They resume their positions.)

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Mine!

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

(Jerry wins. Elaine starts measuring up Jerry’s couch.)

GEORGE: Congratulations...congratulations.

JERRY: Thanks.

GEORGE: I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?

(Kramer slides into the apartment.)

KRAMER: Jerry, I think I’m on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: The last couple a days he’s been acting very strange. I think he’s avoiding me.

JERRY: Hard to imagine.

KRAMER: Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, “Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.”

KRAMER: ..you know, very casually,

JERRY: Right.

KRAMER: (cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.

ELAINE: So what did he say?

KRAMER: “What stuff?”

JERRY: Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!

KRAMER: No, you don’t understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I’m gonna go over there, I’m gonna borrow some tea. If I don’t get back in five minutes, maybe you’d better call the police.

JERRY: Okay, starting...NOW!

(Jerry looks at his watch.)

KRAMER: Yeah!

(Kramer darts off.)

 

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when you’re a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, “I got the front seat” “I wanted the front seat!” “I called it”. And the other kid knows he’s got nothing to say: “He called it. What can I do?” If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. “Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat” And the judge would go, “Did he call it?” “Well no, he didn’t call-” BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) “He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry is sitting at a table, George returns from the bathroom.)

GEORGE: I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don’t know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I don’t know if it’s the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.

JERRY: It’s a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin’?

GEORGE: I don’t know, I can’t eat. You, you can’t have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, I’m sittin’ here with a carrot! They’re closing in on a hundred, I’m sayin’ to them, “How can you eat that stuff?” (They look at their menus again.) I’m so sick about losin’ that choose, you don’t know.

JERRY: All right, forget it, forget it. I’m not taking the place!

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: How can I live there?

GEORGE: Why not?!

JERRY: Look at you, you’re still thinking about it. I’ll never feel comfortable.

GEORGE: Oh, get outta here.

JERRY: How can I ever have you over? You’ll sit there moping.

GEORGE: I won’t mope.

JERRY: You’re already moping! Would you take the place?

GEORGE: No, impossible! It’s your apartment.

JERRY: You found the place.

GEORGE: You won the choose.

JERRY: All right, forget it, it’s over, I’m not moving.

GEORGE: Well, me neither.

JERRY: Definitely?

GEORGE: Definitely.

JERRY: Alright, then just get rid of it. You won’t have any problem.

GEORGE: No, it’s not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.

(A waitress, Carol, approaches.)

CAROL: What apartment?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s a great place, it’s uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd ‘bout half block from the park.

CAROL: What’s the rent?



INT. THE APARTMENT ON 83RD STREET – DAY

(The housewarming party for Carol, the waitress. Jerry, Elaine and George are invited to the house, they’re sitting on a couch, all three moping.)

GEORGE: I don’t know, what we’re doin’ here, this is ridiculous.

JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.

ELAINE: I can’t believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.

(She slaps Jerry on the leg.)

JERRY: If only the coin hadn’t hit the table.

GEORGE: The table is interference, you know it!

JERRY: It is not!

GEORGE: It is too!

ELAINE: My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on “Carousel”.

(Carol approaches them.)

CAROL: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi, Carol.

CAROL: I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.

(Jerry, Elaine and George get up. )

CAROL: This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.

LARRY: Oh, you don’t know how grateful I am, if there’s anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we’re just so thrilled with this place.

CAROL: It’s a dream.

LARRY: I’m running in the park now, I’ve lost weight, we’re barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable.

GEORGE: We’re really glad for you.

ELAINE: Couldn’t be happier.

JERRY: It’s wonderful.

(They sit down again.)

CAROL: Diane, Diane, come here.

(Diane comes to the couch. She is very attractive.)

CAROL: This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.

(Jerry, Elaine and George get up.)

CAROL: (to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. She’s a masseuse!

DIANE: How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it’s such a great location and it’s...so close to the park.

GEORGE: We’re aware of the proximity to the park, yes.

DIANE: Well, it was nice to meet you.

(Diane walks away.)

GEORGE: Nice meeting you.

(George shakes Carol’s hand. The three sit down again. Carol walks away.)

JERRY: How late are the stores open? I’m thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.

(Two men are standing behind the couch, talking.)

MAN #1: I get a call from Gilmour this morning, and get this: they’re restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I gotta be there on the first of the month.

MAN #2: Really? What are you gonna ‘bout the apartment?

MAN #1: Well, what can I do? Give it up.

JERRY, GEORGE & ELAINE: What’s the rent?

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy’s out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it’s true, men hear a drill, it’s like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, “Honey, I think Jim’s working on something over there.” So they run over to the guy. Now they don’t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That’s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, “What are you using, a Phillips-head?” You know, we feel involved. That’s why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that’s just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don’t cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. “What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that’ll hold.”



INT. JERRY’S LOBBY – DAY

(Jerry and George are waiting for the elevator.)

GEORGE: I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.

JERRY: I don’t think you did anything wrong.

GEORGE: I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don’t tell you.

JERRY: We can only thank God for that.

(Elevator opens. They get on.)

GEORGE: I’m outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It’s only a matter of time now.

JERRY: You’re imagining this. Really.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no.

(Elevator doors close.)



INT. ELEVATOR – CONTINUING

GEORGE: I’ll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.

JERRY: What floss? When?

GEORGE: We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there’s this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.

JERRY: Ah, mint.

GEORGE: Of course. So, I’m looking at it. I look up, I see she’s looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..

(Elevator doors open. They get off.)

JERRY: So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.

GEORGE: If I didn’t put that floss in my pocket, I’d be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.

(They approach Jerry’s apartment.)

JERRY: And you’re sure the floss was the catalyst?

GEORGE: Yes, I am.

JERRY: You don’t think it might’ve had anything to do with that?

(Jerry points to George’s fanny pack.)

GEORGE: What? You don’t like this?

JERRY: It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.

(They enter Jerry’s apartment)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – CONTINUING

(Kramer is on the couch, talking on the phone.)

KRAMER: (to the phone) Oh, they’ve got a cure for cancer. See, it’s all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.

(Kramer hands the phone to Jerry.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Who is it?

KRAMER: Take it.

JERRY: Who is it?

KRAMER: It’s for you.

JERRY: (to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesn’t know anything. He’s just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I’m meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday’s okay... All right. Uh, I’m a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.

KRAMER: Well, it’s your phone. He wanted to talk to you.

JERRY: Maybe I didn’t want to talk to him.

KRAMER: Well, why not?

JERRY: He bothers me. I don’t even answer the phone anymore because of him. He’s turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.

GEORGE: What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We’re not going?

JERRY: We’re going. That’s next Wednesday.

GEORGE: Oh. Who is this guy?

JERRY: His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would’ve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. He’s so self-involved.

(Kramer’s cordless phone rings. Kramer pulls it out of his pocket.)

KRAMER: That’s for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...

JERRY: Can you conduct your business elsewhere?

KRAMER: (ignoring Jerry) No no no. I’m talking about a whole chain of ‘em. Yeah.

(Kramer leaves Jerry’s apartment while still on the phone.)

GEORGE: I don’t know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I’ll tell you that.

JERRY: I don’t bother with him. He’s been calling me for seven years. I’ve never called him once! He’s got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he’s paying attention.

GEORGE: I don’t understand why you spend time with this guy.

JERRY: What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, “I don’t think we’re right for each other.” He’s a guy! At least with a woman, there’s a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.

GEORGE: No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.

JERRY: Just break up with him?

GEORGE: Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.

JERRY: The Truth.

(They both careen)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing)

JERRY: As a guy I don’t know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don’t know how to say, “Bill, I feel I need to see other men.” Do you know what I mean? There’s nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that’s the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they’re two guys. That’s almost all we need to have in common. ‘Cause sports – sports and women – is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, “So, what’s in the refrigerator?”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and Joel are sitting at a table.)

JOEL: ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.

JERRY: You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-

JOEL: (to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, we’re starving here! We’ve been waiting here for ten minutes already!

JERRY: (testing Joel) So, I’m thinking about going to Iran this summer.

JOEL: I have to eat! I mean, I’m hypoglycemic.

JERRY: Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, it’s their annual terrorist luncheon.

JOEL: Yeah.

JERRY: (cont'd) I’m gonna do it in Farsi.

JOEL: Do you think I need a haircut?

(A waitress approaches their table.)

CLAIRE: Are you ready?

JERRY: Yeah, I’ll have the egg salad on whole wheat.

JOEL: (to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don’t want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.

WAITRESS: I think it’s real turkey.

JOEL: Is there a real bird in the back?

WAITRESS: No, there’s not bird but-

JOEL: Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don’t you do me a favor. Why don’t you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.

JERRY: How can you talk to someone like that?

JOEL: What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?

JERRY: Listen, Joel. There’s something I have to tell you...

JOEL: (laughing) Wait, you’ll never guess who I ran into.

(Joel pushes out his ears as a hint to Jerry.)

JERRY AND JOEL: Howard Metro.

JOEL: He asked me if I still saw you. I said, “Sure, I see him all the time. We’re still great friends.” Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)

JERRY: Listen, Joel, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.

JOEL: What?

JERRY: This friendship: It’s not working.

JOEL: Not working? What are you talking about?

JERRY: We’re just not suited to be friends.

JOEL: How can you say that?

JERRY: Look, you’re a nice guy, it’s just that... we don’t have anything in common.

JOEL: (starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.

JERRY: Y-You didn’t do anything. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s- this is very difficult.

JOEL: Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you’re a very busy guy.

JERRY: No, it’s not that.

JOEL: (crying) You’re one of the few people I can talk to.

JERRY: Oh, come on. That’s not true.

JOEL: I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, I’m your biggest fan!

JERRY: I know, I know.

JOEL: I mean, you’re my best friend.

JERRY: Best friend- I’ve never been to your apartment.

JOEL: I cannot believe that this is happening. I can’t believe it.

JERRY: Okay, okay. Forget it. It’s okay. I didn’t mean it.

JOEL: Didn’t mean what?

JERRY: What I said. I’ve been under a lot of stress.

JOEL: Oh, you’ve been under a lot of stress.

JERRY: Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I took it out on you. We’re still friends. We’re still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I’ll tell you what. I’ve got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.

(Joel’s tears are clearing up.)

JOEL: Tonight?

JERRY: No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would’ve said tonight.

JOEL: Do you really want me to go?

JERRY: (lying) Yes.

JOEL: Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that’d be great. So, next Wednesday.

JERRY: Next Wednesday.

JOEL: Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!



INT. BANK – DAY

(Jerry is at the counter, filling out a slip. George is carrying a jug full of change.)

GEORGE: ...she calls me up at my office

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: (cont'd) she says, “We have to talk.”

JERRY: Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.

GEORGE: That, or “Who’s bra is this?”

JERRY: That is worse.

GEORGE: So we order lunch, and we’re talking. Finally, she blurts out how it’s ‘not working’.

JERRY: Really.

GEORGE: So, I’m thinking, as she’s saying this, I’m thinking: great, the relationship’s over. But the egg salad’s on the way. So now I have a decision: Do I walk or do I eat?

JERRY: Hm. You ate.

GEORGE: We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.

JERRY: Someone says, “Get out of my life,” and that doesn’t affect your appetite?

GEORGE: Have you ever had their egg salad?

JERRY: It is unbelievable.

GEORGE: It’s unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn’t even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.

(Jerry looks at George’s jug of change.)

JERRY: How much could you possibly have in there?

GEORGE: It’s my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.

JERRY: Yeah? Where’d he go, to an arcade?

GEORGE: (sarcastically) That’s funny. You’re a funny guy.

JERRY: C’mon, move up.

(George moves up in the bank line. There’s a customer in front of him.)

CUSTOMER: Oh great, Ewing’s hurt.

GEORGE: Ewing’s hurt? How long is he going to be out?

CUSTOMER: A couple of days at the most but...

GEORGE: Geez.

JERRY: Oh, God.

GEORGE: I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.

JERRY: Listen, George, little problem with the game.

GEORGE: What about it?

JERRY: The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I gave your ticket to Horneck.

GEORGE: (not believing him) You what?!

JERRY: Yeah, I’m sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.

GEORGE: No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?

JERRY: C’mon, c’mon, go ahead, move up.

GEORGE: Why did you give him my ticket for?

JERRY: You didn’t see him. It was horrible.

GEORGE: Oh, c’mon, Jerry. I can’t believe this.

JERRY: I had to do it.

(George is up to the teller. Jerry goes to another one.)

GEORGE: Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?

TELLER: I’m sorry, sir. We can’t do that.

JERRY: Do you want to go with him? You go. I don’t mind.

GEORGE: I’m not going with him. I don’t even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.

TELLER: Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.

GEORGE: You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!



INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: No, I do not like the bank. I’ve heard the expression “Laughing all the way to the bank.” I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there’s nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it’s empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) “Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I’m almost at the front. I’d like a reward for this please.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is stuffing pennies into rolls.)

GEORGE: ...thirty-two, thirty-three-

JERRY: George.

(George puts up his hand.)

GEORGE: Not now.

(George counts to himself.)

JERRY: Could you stop the counting?

(George loses count.)

GEORGE: Nnnnnnngaaa!

(He dumps out roll.)

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Can I make it up to you? I’ll give you fifty bucks for the jug.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

JERRY: Well, then I’m not going to the game either. Okay? I’ll give him both tickets.

GEORGE: Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!

JERRY: I- no, I don’t want to go.

GEORGE: He was really crying?

JERRY: I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I’ll just make up some excuse why I can’t go to the game either.

GEORGE: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you’re going to lie to the guy, why don’t you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?

JERRY: George, the man wept.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Oh, hey guys. Man, I’m telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.

GEORGE: This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?

KRAMER: Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.

GEORGE: You know, you have to know how to do that. You can’t have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!

KRAMER: It’s all supervised.

GEORGE: Oh, well...

KRAMER: All of it. You want to invest?

GEORGE: My money’s all tied up in change right now.

KRAMER: No, I’m tellin’ you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.

JERRY: I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can’t imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that’s me. Alright

KRAMER: That’s you.

JERRY: I’m just saying..Alright.

KRAMER: Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.

JERRY: Okay.

KRAMER: You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.

(Kramer exits quickly, then sticks his head back through the door.)

KRAMER: One day, you’ll beg me to make your own pie.

(Kramer exits for good. Jerry dials Joel’s number.)

JERRY: (to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can’t make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he’s got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They’re at the Will-Call window... And I’m really sorry... Have a good time... We’ll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don’t... Fine.. Fine... Bye.

(He hangs up.)

GEORGE: Trapezoid?

JERRY: I know. I’m really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Elaine and Jerry are there.)

ELAINE: Come on, let’s go do something. I don’t wanna just sit around here.

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Want to go get something to eat?

JERRY: Where do you want to go?

ELAINE: I don’t care, I’m not hungry.

JERRY: We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.

ELAINE: What are we gonna do there? Talk?

JERRY: We could talk.

ELAINE: I’ll go if I don’t have to talk.

JERRY: Then we’ll just sit there.

ELAINE: Okay. I’m gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...

JERRY: Okay, just hand that over, please.

ELAINE: Oh, what is this?

JERRY: It’s a list of excuses, it’s for that guy, Horneck, who’s at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don’t have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?

ELAINE: I got some for you.

JERRY: I don’t need any more.

ELAINE: No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen: You ran out of underwear, you can’t leave the house.

JERRY: (not amused) Very funny.

ELAINE: How about: You’ve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. You’re not even you. You’re Dan.

JERRY: I’m Dan. Can I have my list back, please?

(Elaine gives Jerry the list.)

ELAINE: Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you’re doing this. This is absolutely infantile.

JERRY: What can I do?

ELAINE: Deal with it. Be a man!

JERRY: Oh no. That’s impossible. I’d rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.

ELAINE: You made a man cry? I’ve never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn’t cry. I got the cab.

JERRY: Couple of tough monkeys.

(Elaine laughs. Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!

JERRY: Game?

KRAMER: Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!

JERRY: Wait. How does Horneck know you?

KRAMER: Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He’s really into my pizza place idea!

JERRY: This is too much.

ELAINE: Wait, what pizza place idea?

JERRY: Oh, no.

KRAMER: You get to make your own pie!

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.

KRAMER: Yea.

JOEL: (from the hallway) Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Perfect.

(Joel enters.)

JOEL: Hey.

KRAMER: Okay, who wants meatloaf?

JERRY & ELAINE: No thanks.

KRAMER: (to Joel) It’s gonna be hot in a minute.

(Kramer exits.)

JOEL: So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?

JERRY: Oh, we finished early.

JOEL: M-hm, I’ll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your ‘nephew’?

(Elaine laughs)

JERRY: Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

ELAINE: Hi.

JOEL: Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?

JERRY: We’re still friends.

JOEL: So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I’m going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why don’t you come along?

ELAINE: Oh, no no. Tuesday’s uh no good becasue we’ve got choir practice.

JERRY: Right. I forgot about choir.

ELAINE: We-We’re doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.

JERRY: Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.

JOEL: What about Thursday night? I mean they’re playing the Sonics.

(Jerry shakes his head.)

ELAINE: Huh... Thursday is no good because we’ve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.

JOEL: You know, I should really try something like that.

JERRY: You really should.

JOEL: Well, let’s just take a look here.

(Horneck looks at his schedule.)

JOEL: Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night we’ve got the Mavericks. If you don’t like the Mavericks, next Tuesday: Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let’s see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You can’t miss Air Jordan...



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: You know, I really... I’ve come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they’re just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don’t really wanna see them. You don’t call them, they call you. You don’t call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don’t really have anything in common with is to pretend you’re hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there’s a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there’s no way you can say, “Hey, it’s been great having you on the show. We’re out of time.”

JERRY: Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money’s a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don’t care about money when you’re hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you’re like the ruler of an empire. “More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives.” Then after the meal, you know, you’ve got the pants open, you’ve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They’re mystified by the check. “What is this? How could this be?” They start passing it around the table, “Does this look right to you? We’re not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a booth.)

JERRY: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny.

JERRY: But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed. I’m sure he’s got super humor.

GEORGE: You would think that, but either you’re born with a sense of humor, or you’re not. It’s not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.

JERRY: Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But he ain’t funny.

(Elaine joins them. The boys check their watches.)

ELAINE: I know, I know. I’m sorry I’m late.

JERRY: No problem.

ELAINE: I dropped a grape.

GEORGE: Pardon?

ELAINE: I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn’t find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.

JERRY: Were you crying? I mean, it’s just a grape. You’ll find it.

ELAINE: No, I’m just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I’m going out with...

JERRY: Robert.

ELAINE: Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and I’m allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can’t even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor’s studio so we can’t go there. It’s really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won’t even go away for the weekend because of these cats.

GEORGE: Guys with cats... I don’t know.

JERRY: I’ve been thinking about asking this girl I’m, uh, seeing-

ELAINE: Vanessa.

JERRY: Vanessa, thank you. I’ve been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no no. I’d have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let’s see, you’re going to be with her seventy-two hours. That’s a dating decathlon.

ELAINE: (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don’t you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She’ll love it.

GEORGE: That’s exquisite. Listen, uh, if it’s not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?

(Elaine gets the paper, and George starts flipping through it.)

JERRY: You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.

(Elaine gives Jerry a look)

GEORGE: Up again?! This is incredible! I’m.. I’m getting it.

ELAINE: You’re getting what?

GEORGE: A stock.

JERRY: What stock?

GEORGE: Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?

JERRY: Maybe.

GEORGE: He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he’s got some new thing. You know, there’s supposed to be a big merger. He wasn’t even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.

JERRY: How high’s it suppose to go?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?

JERRY: Boy... I don’t know.

ELAINE: I’d do it but I don’t have any money.

JERRY: What kind of company is it?

GEORGE: It’s called Sendrax. They’ve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.

ELAINE: Televising opera?

GEORGE: Some sort of electronic thingy.

JERRY: Well, how much are you going to invest?

GEORGE: Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.

JERRY: Boy...

GEORGE: C’mon. Wilkinson’s got millions invested in this stock. It’s gone up three points since I’ve been watching it.

JERRY: What if I lose it?

GEORGE: C’mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We’ll do it together. Come on, come on. We’re in it together.

JERRY: All right. Twenty-five hundred.

GEORGE: That’s it.

(The waitress arrives.)

WAITRESS: Yeah, can I take your order?

GEORGE: (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.

JERRY: My bet? All right. I’ll open with a tuna sandwich.

ELAINE: Tuna?

JERRY: Oh, the dolphin thing?

ELAINE: They’re dying in the nets.

JERRY: Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.

ELAINE: Jerry, can’t you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?

JERRY: Hey, when I’m driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I’m always waving everybody in. “Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.” ...All right. All right. I’ll have a chicken salad.

ELAINE: And I’m going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.

WAITRESS: Okay. (To George) What about you?

GEORGE: I’ll have the tuna.



INT. SUPERMARKET – NIGHT

(Jerry and Vanessa are on a date.)

JERRY: I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.

VANESSA: Why didn’t you do something?

JERRY: What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, I’m risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?

STOCK BOY: No puffs. Just flakes.

JERRY : Have you thought any more about that trip?

VANESSA: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it.

JERRY: You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.

VANESSA: I don’t know. I just worry about trips like this. It’s a lot of pressure.

JERRY: It’s great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It’s like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.

VANESSA: Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?

JERRY: Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.

VANESSA: Really? Could we go fishing up there?

JERRY: Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?

VANESSA: They have marlin in Vermont?

JERRY: Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)

(Jerry picks up a newspaper.)

VANESSA: Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.

JERRY : I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is looking at a road map. Kramer enters with a newspaper.)

JERRY: Is that my paper?

KRAMER: Bad news, my friend.

JERRY: What? What news?

KRAMER : Sendrax.

JERRY: Oh, c’mon! It’s down again?!

KRAMER: Two and a half points.

JERRY: Oh, I can’t believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) That’s four and a half points in three days! That’s almost half my money!

KRAMER: Hey, I told you.

JERRY: (sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.

KRAMER: It’s all manipulated with junk bonds. You can’t win.

(Jerry picks up the reciever of his phone, and dials.)

JERRY: There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.

KRAMER: Hey, I don’t care. I’m just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!

JERRY: (to the phone) George, what’s going on?!

KRAMER: Sell it, just say I’m selling!

JERRY: (to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my money’s gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn’t been home or in his office in the past three days!

KRAMER: You know, I can’t believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could’ve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.

JERRY: Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?

KRAMER: Okay, you’re in a restaurant. You’ve got a very big meeting coming up...

JERRY: Okay...

KRAMER: (looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!

JERRY: (going along with it) Oh No!

KRAMER: You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then you’re gone.

JERRY: You’re gone all right.

KRAMER: (Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...

JERRY: Yeah, I’m going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.

KRAMER: Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.

JERRY: What friends?

KRAMER: Well, it’s just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) ‘Cause they’re really good people, Jerry. I’m telling you. You know, they’re anarchists. They’re.. they’re.. they’re.. huge.

(Jerry answers the phone.)

JERRY: George- What?! You’re kidding... Well, what’s wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I’ll speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy who’s supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he’s in the hospital.

(Kramer smiles.)



INT. DRY CLEANERS – DAY

(Jerry and George are in line. )

JERRY: So you don’t know what’s wrong with him?

GEORGE: All Simons was able to find out is that he’s in the hospital.

JERRY: Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?

GEORGE: Of course he’s been in touch with him. He’s left two messages. He just hasn’t heard back yet, that’s all.

JERRY: Well, this is it. I’m selling.

GEORGE: Just give it a little more time.

JERRY: I never should’ve gotten involved in this. I’m a nervous wreck. I’m not cut out for investing.

GEORGE: All right, all right. That’s it. I’m gonna go down there.

JERRY: Where?

GEORGE: To the hospital.

JERRY: The hospital?

GEORGE: I’m going to find out what’s going on. All right?

JERRY: Are you nuts? You don’t even know the guy.

GEORGE: So what? I’ll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I’ll work my way around to it.

JERRY: What if he’s in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) “How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?” (He makes a hissing sound.) “By the way, what’s happening with Sendrax?”

GEORGE: Maybe he’s resting.

JERRY: Who goes to the hospital to rest?

GEORGE: What are you, a doctor?

JERRY: Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?

GEORGE: Today. I’m going today. Just don’t do anything until you hear from me.

JERRY: All right.

(Jerry moves up in line; a woman takes his place. George does not notice.)

GEORGE: (to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.

(Woman gives him a look.)

DRY CLEANER: (to Jerry) May I help you?

JERRY: Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It’s completely shrunk. There’s absolutely no way I can wear it.

DRY CLEANER: When did you bring it in?

JERRY: What’s the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!

DRY CLEANER: You got a receipt?

JERRY: I can’t find the receipt.

DRY CLEANER: You should get the receipt.

JERRY: Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It’s a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!

DRY CLEANER: Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?

JERRY: What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don’t even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That’s what I want. I want an admission of guilt.

DRY CLEANER: Maybe you asked for it to be washed.

JERRY: No! Dry-cleaned.

DRY CLEANE: Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-

JERRY: You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!

DRY CLEANER: (looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it.



INT. COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, “Well, it’s ruined.” And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, “It’s not our fault. We’re not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.” You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They’re cleaning our clothes, but they’re not getting anything wet. It’s all dry. I know there’s gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they’re using. There’s no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) That’s dry cleaning. I don’t think that’s what they’re doing back there. They don’t have eighty guys going, “Come on, hurry up! There’s a lot of shirts today!”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry and Elaine are there. Elaine sneezes.)

JERRY: Bless you.

ELAINE: Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they’re clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can’t count to ten, so don’t give me hygiene.

JERRY : So what are you gonna do?

ELAINE: I don’t know. I can’t think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?

JERRY: Well, it couldn’t be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?

ELAINE: What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?

JERRY: I’m no cat killer.

ELAINE: How about we go over there right now and we shave them?

JERRY: I’d really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.

ELAINE: He actually went to the hospital?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Oh man, he’s nuts.

JERRY: Yeah, he’s nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. It’s down again.

KRAMER: How much are you down altogether?

JERRY: I don’t know.. fifteen hundred dollars.

KRAMER: Wow.

JERRY: You don’t have to say “Wow.” I know it’s “Wow.” (Kramer smiling) And there’s that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) It’s George.

(Jerry presses the button to let George in. Elaine goes into the bathroom. Kramer picks up some binoculars and looks out the window.)

KRAMER: Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.

JERRY: I really don’t need to look.

KRAMER: What a body. Yeeaahh. That’s for me.

JERRY: Yeah, and you’re just what she’s looking for too – a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.

KRAMER: I’m gonna go down there and try and talk to her.

(Kramer exits. George enters and flops onto the couch.)

JERRY: What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you what’s gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?

GEORGE: Fifteen seconds.

JERRY: You told him you knew Simons?

GEORGE: Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I’m in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I’ll tell you one thing. I don’t know what he’s got. But for a sick guy, he’s very strong.

(Elaine exits bathroom.)

JERRY: Well, that’s it. Look, I’m going to Vermont. I don’t want to think about this. I’m selling.

ELAINE: Didn’t work, huh?

GEORGE: (laughs) Not quite.

ELAINE: We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?

GEORGE: I’m keeping it. I’m going down with the ship.



INT. COUNTRY INN’S LOBBY - DAY

(Jerry and Vanessa are well into their weekend together. It’s raining outside.)

JERRY: So I know this guy. I’m getting all my sneakers at a discount now.

VANESSA: I know. You mentioned it.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right.

JERRY: (thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I’ve still got another day! I’ve got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) That’s a nice watch. Do you wind it?

VANESSA: No, it’s got a little battery.

JERRY: Well, that’s good.

JERRY: (thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I’m speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don’t care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?

VANESSA: No, it’s okay.

JERRY: So, I guess you don’t find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?

VANESSA: Not especially.

JERRY: Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?

VANESSA: What can we do? It’s raining.

JERRY: We cold play “Sorry!” We cold play “Steal the Old Man’s Bundle.” (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that you’re wearing?

VANESSA: Oh, you’ve never heard of it.

JERRY: No, what? What kind is it?

VANESSA: I can’t tell you.

JERRY: (thinking) Yeah, that’s normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?

VANESSA: That stock? I thought you got out of that?

JERRY: I did. I’m just curious. It’s been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) It’s up six points!

VANESSA: I told you not to sell.

JERRY: You did not tell me not to sell.

VANESSA: I said the market fluctuates. Remember?

JERRY: Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!

VANESSA: That’s probably why we're-

(She stops herself.)

JERRY: What?

VANESSA: Forget it.

JERRY: No, what? ‘That’s probably why..’

VANESSA: That’s probably why we’re staying here, because you lost money on the stock.

JERRY: (thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(Jerry, George and Elaine are there, having just eaten.)

GEORGE: (laughing) Have something else. C’mon, have a little dessert?

JERRY : I’m good, thanks.

GEORGE: Elaine, get something! It’s all taken care of.

ELAINE: I’m kinda full.

GEORGE: So don’t finish it.

JERRY: (acidly) She’s full. So, Big Daddy. I’m just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?

GEORGE: I don’t like to discuss figures.

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: I don’t know, what? Eight thousand. It’s a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.

JERRY: So, Wilkinson’s out of the hospital now?

GEORGE : No. You’d be surprised. You don’t recover that quickly from a nose job.

(Elaine sneezes.)

ELAINE: Oh god.

JERRY: Is that still from the cats?

ELAINE: No, I just have a cold.

JERRY: So, what ever happened with that?

ELAINE: I gave him an ultimatum.

(Jerry looks at her. Elaine shrugs.)

GEORGE: He chose the cats?

ELAINE: They’re very clean animals.

JERRY: I gotta say, that’s pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.

ELAINE: Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.

GEORGE: I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can’t get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You’d get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...

ELAINE: Superman can go back in time?

JERRY: We went over that.

GEORGE: Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinson’s got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. They’re about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.

JERRY: A robot butcher?

GEORGE: Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there’s very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I’m not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I’ve decided I’ll do the work. I’m gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? ‘Cause you send your money out there – working for you – a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, “What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me.” “Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.”

JERRY: I’m always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, “Is this the best lane for me? For my life?” They’re always a little bit ahead of you, “Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?” “Yeah, come on over here, pal. We’re zoomin’ over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.” The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we’ll be going, (Jerry pretends he’s driving in reverse.) “Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. I’m gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.”



INT. JERRY’S CAR

(Jerry is in the driver’s seat, and George is in the passenger seat.)

GEORGE: She can’t kill me right?

JERRY: No, of course not.

GEORGE: People break up all the time.

JERRY: Everyday.

GEORGE: It just didn’t work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn’t.

JERRY: You tried.

GEORGE: I kept looking at her face. I’d go, “C’mon, love her. Love her!”

JERRY: Did you tell her you loved her?

GEORGE: Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She’d tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. I’d go, “Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, that’s, that’s something.” But, eventually you have to come back with, “Well, I love you.” You know, you can only hold out for so long.”

JERRY: You’re a human being.

GEORGE: And I didn’t even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I can’t do that to someone.

JERRY: You’re too nice a guy.

GEORGE: I am. I’m a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I’m sitting on the couch, she’s on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she’s on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn’t do that. I would’ve insulted her.

JERRY: You’re flesh and blood.

GEORGE: I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn’t want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. “This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father...” It’s like I’m in quicksand.

JERRY: I told you when I met her.

GEORGE: My back is killing me.

JERRY: You gotta go to my chiropractor, he’s the best.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, everybody’s guy is the best.

JERRY: I’m gonna make an appointment for you. We’ll go together.

GEORGE: Please. They don’t do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can’t I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.

JERRY: You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!

(Car door opens. It’s Elaine.)

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

(George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back.)

ELAINE: Hey, what are you doing?

GEORGE: I’m letting you in.

ELAINE: Oh no. No. I don’t want to sit in the back. I’ll be left out of the conversation.

GEORGE: No, you won’t.

ELAINE: Yes, I will, George. I’ll have to stick my chin on top of the seat.

GEORGE: Okay.

(George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the middle.)

ELAINE: Why can’t you sit in the middle?

GEORGE: Please, it doesn’t look good. Boy, boy, girl.

ELAINE: You’re afraid to sit next to a man. You’re a little homophobic, aren’t ya?

GEORGE: Is it that obvious?

(Elaine sits in the middle.)

ELAINE: Hello, Jerry.

JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: Did you get a haircut?

JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?

ELAINE: Tell me if you think this is strange. There’s this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He’s a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we’d run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He’s a nice guy, he’s got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that’s where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn’t nod. Like I don’t exist?! He went from nods to nothing.

GEORGE: (singing; imitating Tony Bennett) “You know, I’d go from nods to nothing...”

ELAINE: And now, there’s this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, it’s like we really hate each other. It’s based on nothing.

JERRY: A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in “The Blob”.

GEORGE: I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.

ELAINE: Really?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: You would do that?

GEORGE: If I was a different person.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is on the phone.)

JERRY: Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I’m sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...

(The other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials. Kramer enters. The intercom buzzes; Kramer answers it.)

KRAMER: (to the intercom) Come on up.

JERRY: (to the phone) Oh, it’s you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn’t have had to do this. Now that’s two long distance calls I made to you why can’t you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.

(Kramer holds up some cantaloupe.)

KRAMER: Taste this.

JERRY: No, I just had a sandwich.

KRAMER: No, taste it. Taste it.

JERRY: I don’t want cantaloupe now.

KRAMER: You’ve never had cantaloupe like this before...

JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...

KRAMER: ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.

JERRY: ...all right!

(Jerry tastes it.)

KRAMER: Uh-huh. It’s good?

JERRY: It’s very good.

KRAMER: Good, huh?

JERRY: Good.

KRAMER: I got it at Joe’s.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: Forty-nine cents a pound. That’s practically half than what you’re paying at the supermarket. I don’t know why you don’t go to Joe’s.

JERRY: It’s too far.

KRAMER: It’s three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..

JERRY: I’m not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll ‘em down below my knee?

KRAMER: See, the other thing is, if you don’t like anything, he takes it right back.

JERRY: I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.

(Enter George. He dances around the room, singing the Zorba theme.)

GEORGE: I’m outta there. I did it! It’s over.

JERRY: You did it? What happened?

GEORGE: I told her. In the kitchen – which was risky ‘cause it’s near all the knives. I started with the word “Listen.”

JERRY: Uh-huh...

GEORGE: I said, “Listen Marlene,” and then the next thing I know, I’m in the middle of it. And there’s this voice inside of me going, “You’re doing it! You’re doing it!” And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, “Keep going, keep going. You’re almost out!” It’s like I was making a prison break, you know, and I’m heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She’s firing at me from the guard tower. “Son of a bang! Son of a boom!” I get to the top of the wall – the front door. I opened it up, I’m one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!

JERRY: See, it’s never as bad as you imagine.

KRAMER: I liked Marlene. What’s her number?

GEORGE: Uh, no, I, I don’t think so.

(Kramer is eating cantaloupe.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?

KRAMER: George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.

GEORGE: Oh no, thank you.

KRAMER: It’s the best cantaloupe I ever had.

GEORGE: No, really. No, no, thanks.

KRAMER: Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.

JERRY: It’s very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So that’s it? You’re out?

GEORGE: Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.

JERRY: So, go get them.

GEORGE: Oh, no no, I can’t go back there. Jerry, it’s so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, I’d be right back where I started from.

JERRY: So forget about the books. Did you read them?

GEORGE: Well, yeah.

JERRY: What do you need them for?

GEORGE: I don’t know. They’re books.

JERRY: What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they’re trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?

GEORGE: They’re my books.

JERRY: So you want me to get the books? Is that it?



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(Jerry and Marlene are sitting at a booth. Marlene has a milkshake. A pile of books are on the table.)

MARLENE: ...so, it must’ve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone’s just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I don’t know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, “Marlene, just do it.” And I jumped in. And as I’m getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.

JERRY: So what’d you do?

MARLENE: Well, nothing. It’s no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn’t see what the big attraction was.

JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.

MARLENE: Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don’t see each other anymore, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stay friends.

JERRY: No.

MARLENE: Good enough. I’m really glad we got that settled.



INT. CHIROPRACTOR’S WAITING ROOM – DAY

(Jerry and George are reading magazines.)

JERRY: I don’t know how this happened.

GEORGE: Jerry, it’s not my fault.

JERRY: No, no. It’s not your fault. “Books, books, I need my books.” Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it’s not like Marlene’s a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we’ve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And it’s these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I’m busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she’s in the middle of a sentence!

GEORGE: It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?

JERRY: (disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes she’ll go, (imitates Marlene) “Hello, Jerry?” And I’ll go, “Oh, hi Marlene.” And then it’s “Jerry...”

JERRY & GEORGE: “I dunno sometimes...”

GEORGE: What trying to get off the phone?

JERRY: (more disgusted) Ohhhh! You can’t! It’s impossible! There’s no break in the conversation where you can go, “All right then...” You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.

GEORGE: Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Don’t you think?

JERRY: Yeah. Yes, she is.

(The RECEPTIONIST enters.)

RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah.

RECEPTIONIST: The doctor will see you now.

GEORGE: (to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I’m going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren’t I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctor’s office.) “Oh, hello, Doctor.”



INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. ‘Cause it says “Waiting Room.” There’s no chance of not waiting. ‘Cause they call it the waiting room, they’re gonna use it. They’ve got it. It’s all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you’ve got your little magazine. You pretend you’re reading it, but you’re really looking at the other people. You know, you’re thinking about about them. Things like, “I wonder what he’s got. As soon as she goes, I’m getting her magazine.” And then, they finally call you and it’s a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen. I’ll see you all later.” You know, so you think you’re going to see the doctor, but you’re not, are you? No. You’re going into the next waiting room – the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don’t wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don’t want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, “I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in?” Do they scalp tickets to these things? “I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...”



INT. CHIROPRACTOR’S WAITING ROOM – DAY

(George returns from his appointment to meet Jerry.)

JERRY: So, how was it?

GEORGE: I was in there for two minutes. He didn’t do anything. Touch this, feel that – seventy-five bucks!

JERRY: Well, it’s a first visit.

GEORGE: What’s seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I don’t understand this. I’m only paying half.

JERRY: You can’t do that.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: He’s a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.

GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.



INT. JERRY’S CAR – NIGHT

(Jerry is dropping off Marlene.)

MARLENE: Are you feeling weird?

JERRY: No, I’m fine.

MARLENE: Nothing really happened.

JERRY: Yeah, I know.

MARLENE: We just kissed a little. People kiss.

JERRY: Yeah.

MARLENE: Well... night.

(She leans over and kisses Jerry on the cheek. She exits the car. Jerry is stunned.)

JERRY: (belated) Good night.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Kramer enters with a golf club.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I got it! This time, I got it!

JERRY : All right.

(Kramer sets up to show his golf swing.)

KRAMER: Hips! See, it’s all hips.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: You gotta come through with the hips first.

(He swings at an imaginary golf ball. Jerry looks off into the distance, at the ball.)

JERRY: That is out there.

(Kramer notices Jerry is eating cantaloupe; his eyes light up.)

KRAMER: Joe’s?

JERRY: No, supermarket.

KRAMER: Well, is it good?

JERRY: It’s uh okay.

KRAMER: Let me taste it.

(He takes a bite and immediately spits it out.)

KRAMER: See, that stinks. You can’t eat that. You should take that back.

JERRY: I’m not taking it back.

KRAMER: All right, I’ll take it back. I’m going by there.

JERRY: I don’t care about it.

KRAMER: Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.

JERRY: All right. Take it back.

(Jerry’s phone rings. He is reluctant to answer it. The machine picks up.)

JERRY’S MESSAGE: “Leave a message, I’ll call you back.”

MARLENE: (from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I’m not talking into the soap right now, call me back.

KRAMER: Well?

JERRY: Marlene.

KRAMER: (smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...

JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night – we kinda started up a little bit in the car.

KRAMER: I thought you were trying to get rid of her?

JERRY: I was. But, she’s got me, like, hypnotized.

KRAMER: Does George know?

JERRY: No, he’d go nuts.

KRAMER: Yeah, no kidding.

JERRY: I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, I’ve seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can’t go any further, but... She’s just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can’t breathe. It’s like a drug.

KRAMER: Whoa, psychosexual.

JERRY: I don’t know how I’m going to tell him.

KRAMER: Man, I don’t understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?

JERRY: It’s partially you, yeah.

KRAMER: You’re his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn’t even know?

JERRY: Well, he can’t kill me, right?

KRAMER: You’re a human being.

JERRY: I mean, she called me. I haven’t called her. She started it.

KRAMER: You’re flesh and blood.

JERRY: I’m a nice guy.

(Elaine enters, holding a desk lamp in the shape of an airplane.)

ELAINE: Hi.

(She hands Jerry the lamp.)

JERRY: (excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.

ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. That’s hard to get used to when you’re in so many other fast ones.

JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don’t have to be home on time.

ELAINE: Unless you’re married to a dictator.

JERRY: Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.

ELAINE: Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebody’s going to offer me some cantaloupe?

KRAMER: Nope. No good.

JERRY: Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.

KRAMER: Well, I’m taking this back.

(Kramer exits.)

ELAINE: So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.

JERRY: Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: You talked to him?

ELAINE: Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, “No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.”

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, “Hi, remember me?” And he furrows his brow, as if he’s really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, “You little phony. You know exactly who I am.”

JERRY: You said "you little phony"?

ELAINE: I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, “Oh, yeah. You’re Jeanette’s friend. We did meet once.” And I said, “Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?”

JERRY: This is amazing.

ELAINE: And he says, he says, “Look, I just didn’t want to say hello anymore, All right?” And I said, “Fine. Fine. I didn’t want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I’m aware of it!”

(Elaine tastes some cantaloupe.)

JERRY: You are the Queen of Confrontation. You’re my new hero. In fact, you’ve inspired me. I’m gonna call George about something right now.

ELAINE: This cantaloupe stinks.

(She spits it out in a napkin.)



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a table for two.)

GEORGE: (considers for a second) I don’t care.

JERRY: You’re kidding.

GEORGE: No, I don’t care.

JERRY: You mean that?

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: You don’t care?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: How could you not care?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But I don’t. I’m actually almost happy to hear it.

JERRY: I thought you’d be upset.

GEORGE: I guess I should be, but I’m not.

JERRY: Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?

GEORGE: You’re a fine person. You’re a humanitarian. She’s very sexy.

JERRY: That voice. That voice. She’s driving me crazy.

GEORGE: I know. I know.

JERRY: So I can see her tonight, and you don’t care?

GEORGE: See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She’s too crazy for me.

JERRY: All right. As long as you’re okay. Because I can’t stop thinking about her.

GEORGE: I’m okay. I’m fine. I’m wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.

JERRY: Good. And I’ll tell you what... You don’t have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.

GEORGE: (shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!

JERRY: I had to.

GEORGE: He didn’t do anything, Jerry. It’s a scam! Who told you to do that?

JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.

GEORGE: Oh, I was trying to make a point.

JERRY: Why don’t you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) What’s wrong?

GEORGE: (gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!



INT. JERRY’S CAR – NIGHT

(Jerry and Marlene are parked outside Jerry’s building.)

JERRY: So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?

MARLENE: I’m sorry, Jerry. I just don’t think this is gonna work.

JERRY: Really? I thought...

MARLENE: I know, I’m sorry.

JERRY: Gee, I just didn’t expect it from the way you’ve been acting.

MARLENE: You sure you want to talk about this? ‘Cause I sure don’t.

JERRY: Of course I want to talk about it.

MARLENE: Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.

JERRY: Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?

MARLENE: I saw your act.

JERRY: My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?

MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didn’t make it for me. It’s just so much fluff.

JERRY: I can’t believe this. So what are you saying? You didn’t like my act, so that’s it?

MARLENE: I can’t be with someone if I don’t respect what they do.

JERRY: You’re a cashier!

MARLENE: Look, Jerry, it’s just wasn't my kind of humor.

JERRY: You can’t go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.

MARLENE: I heard the material.

JERRY: I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Women need to like the job of the guy they’re with. If they don’t like the job, they don’t like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. “Well, right now, I’m the regional management supervisor. I’m in development, research, consulting...” Men on the other hand – if they are physically attracted to a woman – are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don’t really care. Men’ll just go, “Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? You’re just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don’t you shower up, and we’ll get some burgers and catch a movie.”

JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn’t want to move to Florida, but they’re in their sixties, and that’s the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people’s house with a golf cart, jump out, “Let’s go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it!” I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation’s so boring. It’s so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, “What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass.” You know. Come back in, there’s broken glass, everybody’s all upset. “No, I’m all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, I’m fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let’s pick it up right there.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry’s father, Morty, is watching television. His mother, Helen, is ironing his father’s jacket.)

HELEN: You have so many nice jackets. I don’t know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What’s wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can’t wear this!

(Jerry’s phone rings. Helen goes into the bathroom)

MORTY: Are you getting that?

HELEN: I thought you were getting it.

MORTY: Should I pick up?

HELEN: You want me to get that?

MORTY: I’ll get it!

HELEN: I’ll get it!

(They both go for the phone; Helen gets to it first.)

HELEN: Hello?... Hello?

(She hangs up. Jerry enters, wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove.)

JERRY: Hi.

HELEN: Hi.

JERRY: (to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!

(Jerry picks up the remote and turns off the TV.)

MORTY: So, how’d you do?

JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We’ll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.

HELEN: This is your greatest moment? A game?

JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.

MORTY: You know what my greatest moment was, don’t you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.

HELEN: Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?

JERRY: Well, the man’s an individualist – he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he’s doing.

HELEN: But it’s their 50th anniversary.

MORTY: Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.

HELEN: You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.

JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.

HELEN: So bring her.

JERRY: I don’t even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I’ve met them three times in my life.

MORTY: I don’t know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.

HELEN: At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you’ll leave.

MORTY: How come he gets to leave?

JERRY: If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He’s always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it’s because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.

MORTY: And it’s always about Jeffrey, right?

JERRY: Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.

(Enter Kramer.)

KRAMER: Morty, are you coming in?

MORTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey, how’d you do?

JERRY: We won. We’re in the finals on Wednesday.

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: (to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?

KRAMER: I’m completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You’re not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Levels.

JERRY: Levels?

KRAMER: Yeah, I’m getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I’m going to build these different levels, with steps, and it’ll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.

JERRY: You drew up plans for this?

KRAMER: No no. It’s all in my head.

MORTY: I don’t know how you’re going to be comfortable like that.

KRAMER: Oh, I’ll be comfortable.

JERRY: When do you intend to do this?

KRAMER: Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.

JERRY: You’re doing this yourself?

KRAMER: It’s a simple job. Why, you don’t think I can?

JERRY: Oh, no. It’s not that I don’t think you can. I know that you can’t, and I’m positive that you won’t.

KRAMER: Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.

MORTY: Hey, that’s some big job.

JERRY: I, don’t see it happening.

KRAMER: Well, this time, this time you’re wrong. C’mon. I’ll even bet you.

JERRY: Seriously?

HELEN: I don’t want you betting. Morty, don’t let him bet.

KRAMER: A big dinner with dessert. But I’ve got till the end of the month.

JERRY: I’ll give you a year.

KRAMER: No no no. End of the month.

JERRY: It’s a bet.

(They “pinkie swear” to lock the deal.)



INT. MANYA & ISAAC’S APARTMENT – EVENING

(Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Elaine is sitting at the kiddie table, lower than everyone else. Helen and Morty sit across from Jerry. Manya and Isaac sit at the head of the table. Other guests are present as well.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?

ELAINE: No, no. I’m fine.

(Uncle Leo grabs Jerry’s arm.)

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, are you listening to this?

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.

UNCLE LEO: So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.

JERRY: Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?

UNCLE LEO: No, for the walking tours.

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.

UNCLE LEO: That’s exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he’s talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?

JERRY: Mickey Mantle?

(Uncle Leo is confused by this comment.)

ELAINE: (saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!

JERRY: (eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.

ELAINE: Mmm... phenomenal peas.

MORTY: Are you ready for dessert?

JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.

MANYA: (surprised) You’re going?

ELAINE: Oh uh, I don’t really eat dessert. I’m dieting.

JERRY: Yeah, I can’t eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can’t dance.

MANYA : Can’t dance?

HELEN: He’s kidding, Manya.

MANYA: Is that a joke?

HELEN: So, did you hear Claire’s getting married?

MANYA: Yeah, yeah..

HELEN: I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.

JERRY: Horses? They’re like big riding dogs.

ELAINE: What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...

JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.

MANYA: (angry) I had a pony.

(The room goes dead quiet.)

JERRY: Well, I didn’t uh really mean a pony, per se...

MANYA: When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, what’s wrong with that?

JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...

HELEN: Should we have coffee? Who’s having coffee?

MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.

JERRY: Well, I’m sure you did. Who wouldn’t love a pony? Who wouldn’t love a person that had a pony?

MANYA: You! You said so!

JERRY: No, see, we didn’t have ponies. I’m sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..

MANYA: That’s it! I had enough!

(Manya gets up from the table and exits.)

ISAAC: Have your coffee, everybody. She’s a little upset. It’s been an emotional day.

(Isaac exits. Everyone looks at Jerry.)

JERRY: I didn’t know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant’s going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin’ on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn’t make sense. Am I wrong?



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Morty and Helen are collecting their luggage.)

JERRY: I’ll drive you to the airport.

HELEN: No, we’re taking a cab.

JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didn’t put a damper on the trip.

HELEN: Don’t be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.

MORTY: Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.

JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I’m sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.

HELEN: You know, you should give Manya a call.

JERRY: Maybe I will.

(Jerry opens his door. Kramer is standing in the hallway.)

KRAMER: Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.

(He points to the bags.)

KRAMER: Need any help with those?

MORTY: It’s nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?

KRAMER: Oh, well... I decided I’m not gonna do it.

JERRY: (laughing) Really? What a shock.

HELEN: Goodbye, Jerry.

JERRY: Take care.

HELEN: We’ll call you.

(Helen exits.)

MORTY: Bye, Jer.

JERRY: Bye, Dad. Take it easy.

MORTY: Bye, Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah. So long, Morty.

(Morty leaves. Jerry closes the door. He and Kramer enter the kitchen. )

JERRY: So, when do I get my dinner?

KRAMER: There’s no dinner. The bet’s off. I’m not gonna do it.

JERRY: Yes, I know you’re not gonna do it. That’s why I bet.

KRAMER: Ya well, there’s no bet if I’m not doing it.

JERRY: That’s the bet! That you’re not doing it!

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I could do it. I don’t wanna do it.

JERRY: We didn’t bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.

KRAMER: And it could be done.

JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it’s done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!

KRAMER: I don’t want the levels!

JERRY: That’s the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch ‘em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Don’t get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – LATER

(Helen and Morty are back with Jerry.)

HELEN: Who did you talk to?

JERRY: Uncle Leo.

HELEN: And when’s the funeral?

JERRY: I don’t know. He said he’d call back.

MORTY: You know what this means, don’t you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.

HELEN: She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...

JERRY: What?

HELEN: What? Nothing.

JERRY: You don’t think... What? The pony remark?

HELEN: Oh, don’t be ridiculous. She was an old woman.

JERRY: You don’t think that I killed her?

MORTY: You know what the flight back’ll cost us?

JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! I didn’t know she had a pony!

MORTY: Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.

JERRY: The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) That’s probably Uncle Leo.

(Helen picks up.)

HELEN: Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, it’s just one of those things... Sure, sure, we’ll see you then.

(She hangs up.)

HELEN: The funeral’s Wednesday.

JERRY: Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?

HELEN: Two o’ clock, Wednesday.

JERRY: Ah

(Helen looks at Jerry.)

HELEN: What?

JERRY: I’ve got the softball game on Wednesday. It’s the championship.

HELEN: So? You’re not obligated. Go play in your game.

JERRY: I didn’t even know the woman.

HELEN: So don’t go.

JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I don’t even know her last name.

HELEN: Jerry, no one’s forcing you.

JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That’s what I want to know. I mean, it’s the championship, I’m hitting everything.

HELEN: I don’t have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You don’t have anything.

MORTY: I got my sport jacket.

HELEN: You’re not wearing that to a funeral.

MORTY: What’s wrong with it?

HELEN: It looks ridiculous.

MORTY: What? I’m gonna buy a new sport jacket now?

JERRY: I don’t know what to do.

MORTY: (depressed) You know what this funeral’s gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: We don’t understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can’t stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don’t see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let’s make up our mind where we think they’re going.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Elaine and Jerry sit across from George at a booth.)

ELAINE: I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time’s your game?

JERRY: Two Forty-Five.

ELAINE: And what time’s the funeral?

JERRY: Two o’ clock.

ELAINE: How long does a funeral take?

JERRY: Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.

ELAINE: So you can’t do both?

JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn’t expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.

ELAINE: How can you even consider not going?

GEORGE: You know, I’ve been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I’ll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How’s it gonna happen? I just don’t see how it could occur.

ELAINE: You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I’m actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.

GEORGE: They always make me take stock of my life. And how I’ve pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.

JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, “From this moment on, I’m not gonna waste any more of it.” But then you go, “How? What can I do that’s not wasting it?”

ELAINE: Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can’t you have coffee with people?

GEORGE: You know, I can’t believe you’re even considering not playing. We need you. You’re hitting everything.

ELAINE: He has to go. He may have killed her.

JERRY: Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, but I didn’t say I hated anyone who had one.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Who’s going to play left field?

JERRY: Bender.

GEORGE: Bender? He can’t play left. He stinks. I just don’t see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who’s at their funeral? They don’t even know they’re having a funeral. It’s not like she’s hanging out in the back going, “I can’t believe Jerry didn’t show up.”

ELAINE: Maybe she’s there in spirit. How about that?

GEORGE: If you’re a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she’s gonna wanna hang around Drexler’s funeral home on Ocean Parkway?

ELAINE: George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.

GEORGE: You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It’s not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) It’s all mental.

JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now he’s moving to Pheonix.

ELAINE: Phoenix? What’s happening with his appartment?

JERRY: I don’t know. They’ve been in there since, like, World War II. The rent’s three hundred a month.

ELAINE: Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.



INT. FUNERAL HOME – DAY

(The eulogy is in progress. Jerry is in attendance.)

EULOGIST: Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world – a simpler world – with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It’s lustrous coat, it’s flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.

(Jerry sinks in his seat.)



INT. FUNERAL HOME – LATER

(Jerry and Elaine are talking to Helen. Jerry checks his watch.)

JERRY: Well, the game’s starting just about now.

HELEN: It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.

(Morty is talking to his NEPHEW on the other side of the room.)

NEPHEW: I’m not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I’m just an intern. I can’t write a note to an airline.

MORTY: You’ve got your degree. They don’t care. They just want to see something.

(Jerry is talking to Isaac.)

JERRY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was...

(Uncle Leo interrupts.)

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They’re transferring him to Riverside - so he’ll completely revamp that operation, you understand?

JERRY: Yeah.

UNCLE LEO: He’ll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, that’s your cousin.

(Morty is still talking to his nephew.)

MORTY: You don’t understand, I’ve never paid a full fare.

(Jerry and Elaine talk to Isaac.)

JERRY: Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.

ELAINE: Oh, me too.

ISAAC: Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad.

ELAINE: So, I understand you’re moving to Phoenix?

(Jerry shakes his head and walks away.)

ISAAC: Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would’ve liked Phoenix.

ELAINE: Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, what’s happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: Of course it’s very hot there. I’ll have to get uh air conditioner.

ELAINE: Oh, you can have mine. I’ll ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?

ISAAC: Although they say it’s a dry heat.

ELAINE: Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) what’s happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: I don’t even know if I should take my winter clothing.

ELAINE: I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I’ll watch it for you and I’ll live there and I’ll make sure that nothing happens to it.

(Jerry returns.)

ISAAC: Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey’s taking the apartment.

ELAINE: Oh, Jeffrey.

JERRY: You know Jeffery?

ELAINE : Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.

(Helen approaches Jerry.)

HELEN: It’s raining.

(Jerry goes to the window.)

JERRY: It’s raining? It’s raining. The game will be postponed. We’ll play tomorrow.

(Back to Morty and his nephew.)

MORTY: Believe me, I wouldn’t bother you if the army hadn’t closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.

NEPHEW: I can’t. I’ll get in trouble.

MORTY: Oh, for God’s sake!



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George, Jerry and Elaine are sitting at a table. Jerry and George are wearing baseball uniforms.)

GEORGE: Who gets picked off in softball? It’s unheard of.

JERRY: It’s never happened to me before.

ELAINE: I remember saying to myself, “Why is Jerry so far off the base?”

JERRY: I’ll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.

(George consults his stat sheet of the game.)

GEORGE: And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?

JERRY: I thought there were two outs.

ELAINE: I couldn’t believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.

JERRY : It was the single worst moment of my life.

GEORGE: (smiling) What about Sharon Besser?

JERRY: Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.

ELAINE: Makes you wonder, though, doesn’t it?

JERRY: Wonder about what?

ELAINE: You know... (looking up) the spirit world.

JERRY: You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?

ELAINE: I never saw anyone play like that.

JERRY: But I went to the funeral.

ELAINE: Yeah, but that doesn’t make up for killin’ her.

GEORGE: Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.

JERRY: Don’t you think she woulda heard I was there?

GEORGE: Not necessarily.

(Pause.)

JERRY: Who figures and immigrant’s gonna have a pony?

(Elaine laughs)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don’t use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like he’s riding a pony.) “Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I’m talking to you. Behind the barricades!” So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn’t it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... “Baltic, that’s two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, that’s it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.”

JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can’t stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won’t even exist. It won’t. I think eventually we’ll all be wearing the same thing. ‘Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there’s people from the future or another planet, they’re all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, “This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. That’s it.” We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, “That was nice. I could wear that.”



INT. CLOTHING STORE

(Jerry is talking to a SALESMAN. Elaine is also there, holding a book.)

JERRY : I think I’ve seen enough.

SALESMAN: Well, I might have something in the back.

(Salesman exits.)

ELAINE: The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they’d put it out in the front.

JERRY: Why don’t they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, “Just Back.” All back; No front. You walk in the front, you’re immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.

(Elaine laughs. A CUSTOMER approaches, and notices the book Elaine is holding.)

CUSTOMER: Oh, I just read that. That’s terrific.

JERRY: (pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.

CUSTOMER: Alton Benes is your father?

ELAINE: Yeah.

CUSTOMER: I always felt he deserved a wider audience.

ELAINE: I’m not so sure he wants one.

(Customer exits.)

ELAINE: Hey, don’t forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o’clock.

JERRY: I guess I’m coming. I mean...

ELAINE: What? What, you don’t want to go now?

JERRY: No, I’ll go. I’m going.

ELAINE: No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven’t seen my father in a while and... you know...

JERRY: I’m worried I won’t be able to talk to him. He’s such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.

ELAINE: So, that’s why we’re not together anymore.

(Jerry pulls the invisible dagger Elaine just stabbed him with, out of his back. A jacket on a rack catches his eye.)

JERRY: What is this?

(He takes the jacket off the rack.)

JERRY: This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.

ELAINE: Try it on.

(Jerry puts on the jacket. Elaine feels the material.)

ELAINE: Wow, this is soft suede.

JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.

(Elaine grabs the tag.)

JERRY: How much is it?

ELAINE: (shocked) Oh my God.

JERRY: Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?

ELAINE: You have no idea.

JERRY: I have some idea.

ELAINE: No idea.

JERRY: I’ve got a ballpark.

ELAINE: There is no park and the team has relocated.

JERRY: Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.

ELAINE: Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.

(Jerry opens up the jacket and looks at the lining.)

JERRY: What’s with the pink lining and the candy stripes?

ELAINE: Well, it’s just a lining. You can always have it changed.

JERRY: Should I get it? I hate these moments. I’m hearing the dual voices now, you know, “What about the money?” “What’s money?”

(The salesman returns from the back.)

SALESMAN: It looks wonderful on you.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – MORNING

(Jerry is sitting on his couch wearing his new jacket over his pyjamas. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters.)

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey. New jacket?

JERRY: What do you think?

KRAMER: It’s beautiful.

JERRY: Is it me?

KRAMER: That’s definitely you.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: That’s more you than you’ve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?

JERRY: I don’t know. It’s got a pink lining.

KRAMER: Oh... So, what did you pay for this?

JERRY : I paid what it costs.

KRAMER: How much?

JERRY: What’s the difference?

KRAMER: What, you’re not gonna tell me?

JERRY: I’d rather not say it out loud. It’s embarrassing.

KRAMER: Over three hundred?

JERRY: Yes, but let’s just stop it right there.

KRAMER: It’s over four hundred?

JERRY : Really, I’m not answering anymore.

KRAMER: Is it over four hundred?

JERRY: Would you?

(Kramer finds the tag hanging off the mirror.)

KRAMER: Woah, Nelson!

JERRY: I know, I know.

(Kramer walks over to Jerry’s old jacket, hanging by the door.)

KRAMER: What are you gonna do with the leather one?

JERRY: I don’t know.

KRAMER: Well, are you gonna wear it?

JERRY: Maybe.

KRAMER: You’re not going to wear this.

JERRY: Do you want it?

KRAMER: Well, yeah. Okay. I’ll take it. I like the jacket.

(Jerry considers giving up the leather jacket.)

JERRY: Okay, take it.

KRAMER: Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerry’s old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is sitting on the couch. George enters.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...”

JERRY: What is that song?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I’m singin’ it on elevators, buses. I’m singin’ it in front of clients. It’s taken over my life.

JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that.

GEORGE: Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?

JERRY: No, you idiot.

GEORGE: What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin’ me an idiot?

JERRY: You don’t know Robert Schumann? The composer?

GEORGE: Oh, Schumann. Of course.

JERRY: He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.

GEORGE: Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesn’t stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Let’s just go, All right? I can’t believe we’re having dinner with Alton Benes.

JERRY: I know exactly what’s gonna happen tonight. I’m gonna try and act like I’m not impressed, he’s gonna see right through it.

GEORGE: Yeah, he’ll be looking at us like he’s backstage at a puppet show.

JERRY: Let me just get my jacket.

(Jerry enters the bedroom.)

GEORGE: (singing) : “Master of the house/Keeper of the inn...” (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?

JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it’s with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might’ve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.

GEORGE: Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.

JERRY: Absolutely.

GEORGE: It’s fabulous.

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: And I’ll tell you something else, I’m not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I’m not gonna ask. You’ll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores George’s questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Can’t be seven. Don’t tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you’re saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I won’t say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) I’m walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! I’ll tell you what, if you don’t say anything in the next five seconds, I’ll know it was over a thousand.

(George gets ready with his watch. Enter Kramer.)

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?

JERRY: Well, what kind of solid?

KRAMER: I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it’s double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.

JERRY: Birds?

KRAMER: Yeah. A friend of mine, he’s a magician. He’s going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.

JERRY: So take a cab.

KRAMER: They won’t take a cage full of birds.

JERRY: I can’t. I’m on my way out. There’s no way I can do it.

KRAMER: George, do me a solid? Two minutes.

GEORGE: Well, I’m going with him. I’d like to... I’ve never done a ‘solid’ before.

KRAMER: All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.

(Kramer leaves.)

JERRY: (scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S LOBBY – NIGHT

(Jerry and George enter.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...”

(Jerry points to his head with a “crazy” gesture.)

JERRY: Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?

GEORGE: Maybe he didn’t show up.

(George starts to leave the hotel.)

JERRY: What, you don’t want to do this?

GEORGE: I don’t think there’s ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?

JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Where’s Elaine?

GEORGE: I’m nervous.

JERRY: (to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yeah?

JERRY: I’m Jerry, Elaine’s friend, and this is George.

(George offers his hand to Alton.)

GEORGE: It’s a great thrill to meet you, Sir.

(Alton starts hacking. George withdraws his hand. Alton gestures to a couch beside the leather chair.)

ALTON: Sit down. Want a drink?

(Jerry and George sit.)

JERRY: Sure.

(Alton summons the waiter, who approaches.)

ALTON: What’ll you have?

JERRY: (to waiter) I’ll have a cranberry juice with two limes.

GEORGE: And, I’ll have a club soda with no ice.

BENES: I’ll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.

(The waiter exits.)

GEORGE: You like ice?

ALTON: Huh?

GEORGE: I said, do you like ice?

ALTON: Like it?

GEORGE: Don’t you think you get more without it?

ALTON: Where’s Elaine?

JERRY: Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She’s usually pretty punctual. Don’t you find that, George?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She’s punctual... and uh she’s been late, sometimes.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she’s on time, and... sometimes she’s late.

GEORGE: I guess... (chuckles) today she’s late.

JERRY: It appears that way.

GEORGE: Yup.

JERRY: Yup.

(Jerry and George look at the door, anticipating Elaine’s arrival.)

ALTON: Looks like rain.

GEORGE: I know, I know, that’s what they said.

ALTON: Who said?

GEORGE: The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

ALTON: I don’t need anybody to tell me it’s gonna rain.

GEORGE: No, of course not. I didn’t-

ALTON: All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (The waiter returns with the drinks, and distributes them to the men.) Which one’s suppose to be the funny guy?

GEORGE: (pointing at Jerry) Oh, he’s the comedian.

JERRY: I’m just a regular person.

GEORGE: No, no. He’s just being modest.

ALTON: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that.

(Jerry and George turn to the door again. Pause. Jerry gets up.)

JERRY: Would you excuse me a minute? I’m gonna go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.

(George holds on to Jerry’s jacket, but he pulls away and exits. George is alone with Alton.)

GEORGE: I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.

ALTON: Drivel.

GEORGE: Yea, well, maybe some parts.

ALTON: (defensive) What parts?

GEORGE: The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized – I have to make a phone call. I-I can’t believe- Would you-

(George leaves.)



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S BATHROOM – CONTINUING

(Jerry is washing his face. George enters.)

GEORGE: Thank you for leaving me alone with him!

JERRY: That was brutal. I can’t go back out there.

GEORGE: Well, let’s just leave.

JERRY: Elaine’ll kill me.

GEORGE: Where is she?

JERRY: She’s gotta be here soon.

GEORGE: How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that’s it! I’m leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.

JERRY: The waiter was trembling!

GEORGE: If she doesn’t show up, we can’t possibly have dinner with him alone.

JERRY: How are we gonna get out of it?

GEORGE: We’ll say we’re frightened and we have to go home.

JERRY: Yeah, that’s good. He’d clunk our heads together like Moe.

GEORGE: I don’t know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He’ll understand that.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: All fathers are intimidating. They’re intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, “To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I’ll eat whatever I want, I’ll wear whatever I want, and I’ll create whoever I want.”



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S LOBBY – NIGHT

(Jerry and George return from the bathroom.)

ALTON: (to George) Who’d you call?

GEORGE: (improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.

ALTON: What kind of operation?

GEORGE: Bone marrow.

(The hotel’s MANAGER approaches.)

MANAGER: Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yes?

MANAGER: A message for you.

(The manager hands him a message written on a piece of paper. Alton reads it to himself.)

ALTON: From Elaine. She got tied up. She’ll be here in thirty minutes.

(Jerry and George freeze.)



INT. HOTEL LOBBY – LATER

(Alton is in the middle of a rant.)

ALTON: Yeah, they should’ve taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in ‘fifty-three.

JERRY: Well, Guatamala...

GEORGE: Sure, Guatamala...

(Alton gets up.)

ALTON: All right, you boys get yourselves together. We’ll head up to the restaurant. I’ll leave a note for Elaine. I’m going to the bathroom.

(Alton exits.)

GEORGE: Come on, let’s go!

JERRY: What about Elaine?

GEORGE: To hell with Elaine!

JERRY: She’ll be furious.

GEORGE: We’re dying here!

(Elaine enters.)

JERRY: That’s her! She’s here!

ELAINE: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Where is Dad?

GEORGE: (contemptuously, imitating Alton’s voice) He’s in the bathroom.

JERRY: (to Elaine) Where have you been?!

ELAINE: Kramer! That... Kramer! I’m just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...

JERRY: Oh, you didn’t...

ELAINE: Well, he said he’d drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesn’t come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He’s a city marshal. He’s towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, we’re wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we’re running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Alton’s chair and takes a deep breath.) So how’s everything going over here?

JERRY: Great.

GEORGE: Couldn’t be better.

ELAINE: Good. ‘Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.

JERRY: Oh, no, no.

GEORGE: Get outta here..

ELAINE: Man, Kramer! I could kill him!

JERRY: I can’t believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.

ELAINE : He said he’d give me a lift.

JERRY: Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren’s song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?

GEORGE: Where do you come up with this stuff?

(Alton returns.)

ALTON: Well, look who’s here.

ELAINE: Oh, hi, Dad.

ALTON: Hello, dear.

(Alton kisses Elaine.)

ALTON: Who’s the lipstick for?

ELAINE: No one.

ALTON: How’s your mother?

ELAINE: Fine.

ALTON: How about you? Are you working?

ELAINE: Yeah, I’m reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.

ALTON: Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right, boys. We’ll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You’re not afraid of a little spice, are you?

(They all head for the door. Jerry and George trail behind a little.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...”

ALTON: Pipe down, chorus boy.

(Alton glares; George gets embarrassed. Elaine looks out the window.)

ELAINE: Ohh... it’s snowing. It’s beautiful.

JERRY: (to George) Snow. Snow, that can’t be good for suede, can it?

GEORGE: I wouldn’t think so.

JERRY: What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, we’re taking a cab, aren’t we?

ALTON: Cab? It’s only five blocks.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Why don’t you just turn it inside out?

JERRY: Inside out! Great.

(Jerry turns his jacket inside out, exposing the pink stripes. Alton stops him before Jerry can leave the hotel.)

ALTON: Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?

JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.

ALTON: Well, you look like a damn fool!

JERRY: Well, it’s a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.

ALTON: Well, you’re not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. That’s for damn sure.

(Jerry looks to George.)

GEORGE: It’s uh, it's only a few blocks.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is heading out. The intercom buzzes. Jerry presses the first button.)

JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I’ve gotta feed the birds.

JERRY: So?

KRAMER: You got any of those mini Ritzes?

(Jerry reaches up, and pulls some mini Ritzes from atop his refrigerator. He examines the box.)

JERRY: I can’t believe I do.

KRAMER: Yeah! Well, are you going out?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Hey, where’s your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. It’s ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?

JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.

KRAMER: Don’t you know what that does to suede?

JERRY: I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.

ELAINE: Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.

JERRY: Is he still in town?

ELAINE: No, he’s driving back to Maryland tonight.

(Kramer is holding a sleeve of the suede jacket.)

KRAMER: So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?

JERRY: I don’t know.

KRAMER: (smiling) Well...

ELAINE: (to Jerry) I didn’t want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: You gonna throw this out?

JERRY: Well, I can’t wear it.

ELAINE: Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Well, if you’re just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.

JERRY: Yeah, go ahead, take it.

ELAINE: Dad thinks George is gay.

JERRY: Oh, because of all the singing?

ELAINE: No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.

(Kramer returns from the bathroom, wearing the ruined suede jacket.)

KRAMER: Hey, see, I like it like this.

(Elaine points at the jacket Kramer is wearing.)

ELAINE: Isn’t that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you should’ve done? You should’ve turned it inside out.

JERRY: I’ll try and remember that.

(Kramer is holding Jerry’s old leather jacket.)

KRAMER: Boy, it’s too bad you gave me this one too.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad.

(Kramer opens up the suede jacket.)

KRAMER: I’m gonna have to do something about this lining.

(Kramer exits.)



INT. ALTON’S CAR – NIGHT

(Alton is driving home.)

ALTON: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...”



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don’t get this. Aren’t cows outside most of the time? I don’t understand it. When it’s raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, “Let us in, we’re all wearin’ leather. Open the door! We’re gonna ruin the whole outfit here!” “Is it suede?” “I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can’t have this cleaned. It’s all I got!” 

JERRY: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you’re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? “We have soda, we have soda, we have soda”, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It’s a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and you’re watching TV and you’re drinking the exact same product that they’re advertising right there on TV, and it’s like, you know, they’re spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and I’m standing there, “Maybe I’m putting too much ice in mine.”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George and Jerry enter.)

GEORGE: (excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn’t sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don’t know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they’re psychotic or something and I don’t know if I’m supposed to smile back, I don’t know what to do. So I just stood there like – remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That’s what I looked like.

JERRY: So you didn’t ask?

GEORGE: No, I froze.

(Jerry points to the coffee shop’s counter.)

JERRY: Counter.

(Jerry and George sit down at the counter.)

GEORGE: Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I’m back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, “So why don’t you call her?” I says, “I can’t.” I couldn’t, I couldn’t do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.

JERRY: He said wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.

JERRY: So you called.

GEORGE: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.

JERRY: Yeah. Like a farm boy.

GEORGE: Right. So I call her up, I tell her it’s me, she gives me an enthusiastic ‘Hi!’

JERRY: Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That’s beautiful.

GEORGE: Oh, I don’t get the enthusiastic hi, I’m outta there.

JERRY: All right, so you’re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.

GEORGE: So, we’re talking, and I don’t like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, “What are you doing Saturday night?”

JERRY: And?

GEORGE: She bought.

JERRY: Great day in the morning.

GEORGE: Then I got off the phone right away.

JERRY: Sure, it’s like robbing a bank. You don’t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.

GEORGE: It’s amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can’t remember the last time that happened.



INT. GEORGE’S CAR – SATURDAY NIGHT

(George and his date, Carol, are parked outside Carol’s building.)

GEORGE: I can’t stand doing laundry. That’s why I have forty pairs of underwear.

CAROL: You do not.

GEORGE: Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.

(They both laugh.)



INT. JERRY’S CAR – SATURDAY NIGHT

(Jerry and his date, DONNA are parked outside Donna’s building.)

JERRY: (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.

DONNA: That’s Irish.

JERRY: Irish, Scottish, what’s the difference, lassie?

(Donna laughs.)



INT. GEORGE’S CAR – CONTINUED

CAROL: So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.

GEORGE: Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.

CAROL: Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?

GEORGE: Oh, no, thanks. I can’t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.

CAROL: (confused by his response) So, um, okay.

GEORGE: Okay.

CAROL: Goodnight.

GEORGE: Yeah, take it easy.

(Carol exits the car. George realizes what he has done and slaps his forehead in disgust.)



INT. JERRY’S CAR – CONTINUED

DONNA: Thanks again for the movie.

JERRY: You’re welcome.

DONNA: I’d invite you up, but the place is being painted.

JERRY: Oh, that’s okay.

DONNA: Unless you want to go to your place.

JERRY: Okay... but there’s no cake or anything, if that’s what you’re looking for.



INT. GEORGE’S CAR (MOVING) – CONTINUED

GEORGE: (frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry and Donna sit on the sofa.)

JERRY: I think if one’s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It’s common courtesy. I don’t know. That’s just the way I was brought up.

DONNA: Values are very important.

JERRY: Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?

DONNA: Thursday’s great.

(Pause. Jerry looks down at his pants.)

JERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don’t feel comfortable in them.

DONNA: Are those Cotton Dockers?

JERRY: Oh, I can’t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.

DONNA: Really? I like that commercial.

(Donna gets closer and more comfortable leaning on Jerry. Jerry Pauses thinking about what she said)

JERRY: You like that commercial?

DONNA: Yeah, it’s clever.

JERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?

DONNA: Yeah, that’s the one.

JERRY: What could you possibly like about that?

DONNA: I don’t know. I like the, guys.

JERRY: Yeah, they’re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.

DONNA : Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.

(After Jerry sits back again, Donna continues get more comfortable in Jerry's arms. Jerry pauses.)

JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn’t that bother you?

DONNA: (annoyed) That’s the idea. That’s what’s clever about it, that they’re not talking about the pants.

JERRY: But they’re talking about nothing.

DONNA: That’s the point.

JERRY: I know the point.

DONNA: No one is telling you to like it.

JERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?

(Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry and looks at her watch.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: What’s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy’ll be like, “I don’t think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?” And of course the woman’s looking at the guy, thinking, “What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are talking.)

JERRY: I’m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?

ELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didn’t keep his bathroom clean enough.

JERRY: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there – they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

(George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag.)

ELAINE: Hi.

(George produces a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and box of bicarb (sic) from bag, placing them on counter.)

JERRY: You’re still thinking about this?

GEORGE: She invites me up at twelve o’clock at night, for coffee, and I don’t go up. “No thank you. I don’t want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.” I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn’t be allowed to live. I can’t imagine what she must think of me.

JERRY: She thinks you’re a guy that doesn’t like coffee.

GEORGE: She invited me up. Coffee’s not coffee, coffee is sex.

ELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.

GEORGE: Coffee’s coffee in the morning. It’s not coffee at twelve o’clock at night.

ELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.

GEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who’re on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, “Keep it up, don’t blow it, you’re doing great.”

ELAINE: It’s all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.

GEORGE: I can’t call her now. It’s too soon. I’m planning a Wednesday call.

ELAINE: Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.

GEORGE: Of course you do, but you’re imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, “Oh no, I don’t drink coffee late at night.” If I call her now, she’s gonna think I’m too needy. Women don’t wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy – a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.

ELAINE: All she’ll think is that you like her.

GEORGE: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!

ELAINE: Well, she wants you to like her.

GEORGE: Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn’t like me!

ELAINE: I don’t know what your parents did to you.

(Kramer enters and addresses Jerry.)

KRAMER: Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you’re up there, you’re on the stage and you go, “Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone’s in a life-and-death situation, and we’re thinking, “Well, sorry buddy, you should’ve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.”

(Elaine laughs. Jerry humors Kramer with a smile.)

KRAMER: So you gonna use it?

JERRY : I don’t think so.

KRAMER: It’s funny.

ELAINE: It is funny.

JERRY: I like to use my own material.

KRAMER: That’s as good as anything you do.

GEORGE: All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.

JERRY: Why do we have to leave?

GEORGE: Because I can’t call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let’s go.

ELAINE: Oh, see, this is the problem.

JERRY: You’re kicking me out of my house?

GEORGE: Yes.

(Jerry exits. Elaine is in the doorway.)

ELAINE: (encouraging) Don’t forget.

GEORGE: (to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?

JERRY: Don’t do the apples. It’s enough already with the apples.

(Elaine, Kramer and Jerry exit. George removes his jacket and dials the phone.)

CAROL: (from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, it’s Carol, I’ll get back to you.

(A beep follows.)

GEORGE: Um, hi, it’s George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn’t come up for coffee. You see, I didn’t realise that coffee didn’t really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It’s up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball’s in your court. So uh, take it easy.

(George hangs up. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: I’m just gonna get my jacket, I’ll meet you downstairs. What’s the matter, did you call?

(Elaine enters.)

GEORGE: Got her machine. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. That’s it. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. Dead man.

JERRY: What did you say?

GEORGE: I don’t know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there’s nothing I can do. It’s a machine. The little light is blinking right now, “Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot’s on!”

JERRY: After one date you try and improvise on her machine?

GEORGE: Now I’m in the worst position of all.

ELAINE: Y’know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy’s machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn’t supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy’s house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.

GEORGE: He did that?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Somebody did that?

JERRY: She’ll call you back. You’re overreacting.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is in the kitchen. Donna is on the other side of the counter.)

JERRY: Not once.

DONNA: Never?

JERRY: I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.

DONNA: That’s amazing.

JERRY: Thank you.

DONNA: Is there anything else about you I should know?

JERRY: Yes, I’m lactose intolerant.

DONNA: Really?

JERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I won’t stand for it. Um, I’ll be right back.

(Jerry goes to the bathroom. George bursts into the apartment.)

GEORGE: Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, I’m sorry, I didn’t, I had no idea.

(He goes to leave.)

DONNA: Wait, wait. He’s in the bathroom.

GEORGE: I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I’ll come back.

DONNA: You don’t have to leave.

GEORGE: You sure?

DONNA: Yes.

GEORGE: Okay.

DONNA: I’m Donna.

GEORGE: Donna. Oh, you’re the one that likes that commercial!

DONNA: He told you about that?

GEORGE: (back-pedalling) No, he, he didn’t actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial – in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He’s, he’s like a clam. You’re not gonna mention this, to him...

(Jerry re-enters.)

DONNA: (to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I’m not hip because I like that commercial.

JERRY: What? (to George) What did, what did you say?

GEORGE: Say? What? Nothing, I...

DONNA: You told him how I like the commercial.

JERRY: Well, so what if I said that?

DONNA: Well, so, you didn’t have to tell your friends.

JERRY: No, I had to tell my friends – my friends didn’t have to tell you.

GEORGE: (to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?

DONNA: I don’t like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.

GEORGE: Boy oh boy.

JERRY: I said I couldn’t believe you liked that commercial. So what?

DONNA: I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.

JERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.

KRAMER: Oh. Cotton Dockers!

GEORGE: Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...

(George grabs Kramer.)

KRAMER: What? Where are we going?

GEORGE: Come on!

DONNA: Don’t bother, I’m leaving.

JERRY: Donna, really, you’re making too much of this.

KRAMER: “One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they’re not Dockers, they’re just pants”

JERRY: Please, Donna...

DONNA: I don’t wanna hear it.

(Donna leaves.)

GEORGE: I can’t believe I said that. You know me, I’m a vault.

JERRY: Don’t worry about it, it wasn’t working anyway.

KRAMER: What happened there?

JERRY: I’ll tell you later.

GEORGE: You are not gonna believe what’s going on with this woman.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George and Jerry sat at a booth.)

GEORGE: Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn’t call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, “I know you’re there, I don’t know what your story is.” Yesterday, I’m a volcano – I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, “Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don’t call me back for four days? I don’t like coffee, I don’t have to come up. I’d like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.”

JERRY: You said that?

GEORGE: I lost it.

JERRY: I can’t blame you. I can’t believe she never called you back.

GEORGE: She did. Today.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: She called my office. She said she’s been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn’t know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she’s been using her old machine and she doesn’t have the beeper for it.

JERRY: So she didn’t get the messages.

GEORGE: Exactly, but they’re on there – waiting. She said she can’t wait to see me, we’re having dinner tonight. She’s supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.

JERRY: But what about the messages?

(George produces cassette tape from pocket.)

JERRY: Elaine’s thing? How you gonna get in?

GEORGE: I’ll meet her outside the building.

JERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she’s going right for that machine.

GEORGE: Unless she goes for the bathroom. That’s my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I can’t do this, I can’t do this. I don’t even know how to work those stupid machines.

JERRY: There’s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.

GEORGE: You do it for me.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Come on, it’ll be so much easier.

JERRY: How you gonna get me up there?

GEORGE: I’ll tell her I bumped into you, I’m giving you a ride uptown.

JERRY: And who makes the switch?

GEORGE: You do.

JERRY: I do.

GEORGE : I can’t do it. I’ll, I’ll keep her busy.

JERRY: I can’t get involved in this.

GEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.

JERRY: What if she sees me?

GEORGE: Oh, you are such a wuss.

JERRY: A wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Did you call me a wuss?



EXT. CAROL’S BUILDING – NIGHT

(George and Jerry are sitting on a low wall beside the door to the building.)

GEORGE: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.

JERRY: I got one problem. You’re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she’s coming.

GEORGE: A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I’ll call out tippy-toe!

JERRY: Tippy Toe? I don’t think so.

GEORGE: You don’t like tippy toe?

JERRY: No tippy toe.

GEORGE: All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I’ll sing.

JERRY: What song?

GEORGE: “How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?”

JERRY: What is that?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s a lovely song. (singing) “How do you solve a problem like Maria?...”

JERRY: Anything else?

GEORGE: You pick it.

JERRY: “Lemon Tree.”

GEORGE: Peter, Paul and Mary.

JERRY: No, Trini Lopez.

JERRY & GEORGE: (singing) “Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...”

GEORGE: Alright ok. You got the tape?

(Jerry takes out two different sizes of cassettes.)

JERRY: Standard. Micro.

GEORGE: How do you feel? Confident?

JERRY: Feel good.

GEORGE: You nervous?

JERRY: Not at all.

GEORGE: Get up, get up, it’s her! Oh, the hell with this, I’m scared to death, just walk away, it’s off, cancel everything, go!

(Carol enters.)

CAROL: Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.

GEORGE: I, I couldn’t wait. I was too anxious to see you.

CAROL: Oh, that’s so sweet.

GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn’t that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.

JERRY: All the time.

CAROL: It’s nice to meet you.

JERRY: Hi.

CAROL: So, I’m starving. Where are we gonna eat?

GEORGE: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.

CAROL: Okay. Let’s go, I’m ready, where’d you park?

GEORGE: Don’t you wanna go upstairs first?

CAROL: No, what for? I’ll just give my bag to the doorman.

JERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.

CAROL: Oh well there’s a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...

CAROL: Well they have a phone.

(George takes Carol aside.)

GEORGE: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.

CAROL: (aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.

GEORGE: Right, right.

(They enter her building.)



INT. CAROL’S APARTMENT – CONTINUING

(Carol, Jerry and George enter.)

CAROL: The bathroom’s on the hall to the right.

JERRY: Uh, you know, why don’t you go first, you just had a long trip.

CAROL: No, I’m fine.

JERRY: Um, you know, it’s the damnedest thing. It went away.

CAROL: Oh, that’s weird.

GEORGE: No, no that can happen. I’ve, uh, I’ve read about that in medical journals. It’s a freak thing, but...

CAROL: Well, let me just check my messages, and we’ll go.

GEORGE: Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?

CAROL: Sure.

GEORGE: Please, this is very, very important.

(George leads her to another room. Jerry goes over and lifts the lid of the machine.)

GEORGE: (from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!

(Carol reappears, followed by George.)

CAROL: (to Jerry) Now I know who you are! You’re a comedian. I’ve seen you, it’s driving me crazy.

JERRY: Right. I am.

GEORGE: Carol, that’s so rude. Please, I’m serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn’t mind. And then we’ll talk to Jerry.

(George leads Carol back out. Jerry switches the tapes.)

JERRY: (calls) Hey you two. I’m ready to go.

(George and Carol return.)

CAROL: That’s what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Don’t you find that strange?

JERRY: Yes.

CAROL: Well, I’ll just check my machine and we’ll go.

(She lifts the lid of the machine, and drops it.)

CAROL: No, nothing here, let’s go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.

GEORGE: Oh, uh...

CAROL: Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.

(Carol exits. Jerry laughs acidly while looking at George. They exit as well.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry in on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn’t want to talk to, I could go, “Excuse me, I’m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.” I also have a cordless phone, but I don’t like that as much, because you can’t slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!” Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!”
(Jerry searches for the ‘off’ button on his mimed phone, and presses it feebly.) “I told him!”

JERRY: I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don’t know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it’s really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I’ve received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn’t even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that’s what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, “You may have already won.” I’d like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, “You have definitely lost!” You turn it over, giant printing, “Not even close!” You open it up, there’s this whole letter of explanation, “Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is reading a newspaper. Kramer and Jerry struggle to fit a large cardboard box with the name Seinfeld on it, through the doorway.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) To the right.

(They get it through, and walk towards the table.)

GEORGE: That took awhile.

JERRY: Don’t get up.

GEORGE: I’d like to help, but my neck..

(They set the box on the table.)

GEORGE: So how long has it been in the basement?

JERRY: Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn’t want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it’s been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and let’s get it out of here.

(They open the box, and start going through it.)

GEORGE: What’s in it?

JERRY: Grandpa clothes, I can’t wear ‘em.

(Kramer pulls out some black socks.)

KRAMER: You want these? Knee socks. You don’t wear knee socks.

JERRY: No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can’t wait to get it cleaned.

GEORGE: I know someone who’ll do it. She’s good. She’s honest.

JERRY: No, Elaine’s got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he’s suppose to do it.

GEORGE: Students can’t clean. It’s anathema. (explaining) They don’t like it.

JERRY: How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?

(Kramer pulls a statue out of the box.)

KRAMER: Now this I like.

GEORGE: Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramer’s hands.) I can’t believe this! Let me see this.

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait...

(George grabs the statue.)

GEORGE: Let me just see it.

KRAMER: Come on...

GEORGE: Let me just see it for a second.

(He pries it from Kramer’s hands.)

GEORGE: Oh my God, it’s exactly the same!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, “MacArthur Park”, and I got to the part about, “I’ll never have that recipe again,” and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.

(Kramer grabs the statue back. George grips it, but Kramer wont let go. They start to fight for it.)

KRAMER: C’mon, George. I saw it first.

GEORGE: No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.

KRAMER: No, I got dibs!

GEORGE: What? No dibs! I need this statue. C’mon, give it!

(Jerry breaks it up.)

JERRY: Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don’t you just settle it like mature adults?

(Kramer sticks out his fist.)

KRAMER: Potato man!

GEORGE: No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.

(Kramer and George both add up in their heads to see who would lose if Inka-Dink was the way to go.)

KRAMER: Okay...yea well uh start with me.

GEORGE: Yeah, good, good.

(Jerry begins the childish choosing game of Inka-dink, pointing alternately between Kramer and George with every accented syllable.)

JERRY: Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.

(He lands on George. George starts to recalculate his choice.)

JERRY: Not because you’re dirty, not because you’re clean – just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...

(He lands on Kramer. Kramer smiles.)

JERRY: And you are it!

(He lands on George.)

KRAMER: What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He’s out. I get it.

GEORGE: No, no, no, no, I’m It. I win.

JERRY: No, he’s It. He wins. It is good.

KRAMER: Do over – start with him.

JERRY: No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.

KRAMER: All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)

GEORGE: (not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.

KRAMER: Okay, I’m gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.

JERRY: All right, c’mon. Let’s go.

(Kramer puts on the hat.)

KRAMER: Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.

(He hums the theme song.)

GEORGE: I can’t believe I won at Inka-dink.

JERRY: Come on, let’s go.

GEORGE: Yea.

(They go to the door. George sets down the statue on the kitchen counter.)

JERRY: Aren’t you gonna take it?

GEORGE: No, no, no, I don’t want to carry it around all night. I’ll pick it up later.

GEORGE: (to Kramer) What about your stuff?

KRAMER: Oh, uh, well - okay.

(He balls up the clothes in his hands, throws them into his apartment and leaves.)

JERRY: All right, let’s go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: The Inka-dink.. You were It.

GEORGE: It’s bad?

JERRY: It’s very bad.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Elaine and a writer, RAVA, are in the living room.)

RAVA: Well, if they don’t let you be my editor on this book, I’ll go to another publisher. It’s that simple.

ELAINE: You told them that?

RAVA: Of course.

ELAINE: (excited) This is so fantastic. I don’t know how to thank you.

(Jerry enters for the bedroom, carrying luggage.)

JERRY: (to Rava) So, where’s this boyfriend of yours? I can’t wait much longer. I’ve got a flight.

ELAINE: Oh, probably caught in traffic.

RAVA: Or maybe he’s dead.

JERRY: So what do you write, children’s books?

(There’s a knock at the door.)

RAVA: That’s Ray.

(Ray enters with cleaning gear.)

RAY: Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.

(Ray bows.)

JERRY: All right...

RAVA: And we have to get back to work.

(She exits with Elaine.)

JERRY: I gotta get to the airport.

RAY: Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.

JERRY: The uh toilet brush is under the sink.

(Jerry exits.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I don’t really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there’s that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you’re sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, “I’m really sorry about this. I don’t know why I left that stuff over there.” And that’s why I could never be a maid, because I’d have an attitude. I’d find them, wherever they are in the house, “Oh, I suppose you couldn’t do this? No, don’t get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn’t dust. No, this is too tough, isn’t it?”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry is talking to Elaine.)

JERRY: He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!

ELAINE: There’s no Rubber Man.

JERRY: Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There’s Elastic Man... Plastic Man...

ELAINE: I’m leaving.

JERRY: Where are you going?

ELAINE: To Rava’s house. I’ve gotta pick up her manuscript.

JERRY: Oh wait. I’ll go with you.

(They both head toward the door. Jerry opens it.)

JERRY: Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!

(Elaine and Jerry exit.)



INT. RAVA & RAY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry, Elaine, and Rava sit in the living room.)

ELAINE: (to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He’s the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-

RAVA: Demand.

ELAINE: They're going to promote me to editor.

RAVA: Daantotin. (There is a sound of the front door being unlocked.) There’s Ray... late as usual.

(Ray enters.)

RAY: Well, this is an unexpected surprise – and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, we’re in the presence of royalty.

JERRY: Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.

RAY: But I didn’t just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.

JERRY: Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?

(They all laugh. Jerry looks at Ray’s mantle. George’s statue catches his eye.)

RAVA: The water is boiling. Are you having tea?

ELAINE & RAY: Yes.

(Jerry is not listening. Rava enters the kitchen.)

ELAINE: Jerry? Jerry!

(Jerry snaps out of it.)

JERRY: What?

RAVA: (from the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?

RAY: Yeah, I’m coming!

(Ray enters the kitchen. As soon as both Rava and Ray are in the kitchen, Jerry and Elaine start talking in loud whispers.)

JERRY: I think that’s the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!

ELAINE: What statue?

JERRY: I had a statue!

ELAINE: You have a statue? I never saw a statue.

JERRY: My grandfather gave me a statue!

ELAINE: Since when?

JERRY: What’s the difference?! That’s the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!

(Ray pops his head back into the living room.)

RAY: Do you take sugar?

JERRY & ELAINE: Uhh... no.

(Ray goes back into the kitchen.)

JERRY: I can’t believe it! This guy ripped me off!

ELAINE: Do you realize what you’re saying?

JERRY: Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!

(Ray pops in again.)

RAY: Lemon?

JERRY & ELAINE: Uh... sure/yeah..

(Ray goes back into the kitchen.)

ELAINE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.

ELAINE: Ninety-nine percent sure?!

(Ray and Rava both enter, carrying a tray of tea.)

RAY: Ah, sweet elixir. It’s fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.

(Jerry smells it suspiciously. A ding from the kitchen can be heard.)

RAVA: Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript.

RAY: Ah, the pastries!

(Ray and Rava exit in different directions.)

ELAINE: Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it’s just a coincidence.

JERRY: Coincidence? This guy’s in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?

ELAINE: I never saw the statue.

JERRY: I had a statue! What should I do?

ELAINE: I don’t know.

JERRY: I’ll call Kramer. He can check my house.

(Jerry grabs the phone and dials.)

ELAINE: Oh Jerry, don’t blow this for me.

JERRY: Don’t worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... It’s Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...

(Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually into the phone.)

JERRY: Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.

RAVA: My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope she’s rotting in an alley somewhere!

(Pause.)

JERRY: My mom’s down in Florida. She’s got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?

(Ray enters with a tray of pastries.)

RAY: I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.

JERRY: Listen, uh I just remembered... I’m... uh, getting a facial.

(Elaine takes the manuscript.)

ELAINE: Oh, see you tomorrow morning.

(They go to leave.)

RAY: How about dinner?

JERRY: No, I don’t eat dinner. Dinner’s for suckers.

(Elaine and Jerry exit.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry is on the phone. Jerry and Elaine are next to him. Kramer sits in the living room.)

JERRY: Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.

(He hangs up.)

JERRY: Nope, the cop says it’s my word against his. There’s nothing they can do.

KRAMER: Let’s go get him.

JERRY: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: We can’t just let him get away with this.

JERRY: Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it’s missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He’s crazy.

KRAMER: You wanna go get him?

ELAINE: Well, then, if he’s crazy you should just forget it.

GEORGE: Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother’s making her roasted potatoes!

ELAINE: George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?

GEORGE: Who is this Rava?

KRAMER: I say we get him.

ELAINE: No!

GEORGE: Let me just call him.

JERRY: I’ll call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Rava’s friend, Elaine’s friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you don’t want to talk about it over the phone?.. You don’t want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk’s?... All right, tomorrow... One o’ clock... Great, okay, bye.

(Jerry hangs up.)

ELAINE: All right, look, look, look. Let’s say he stole it.

GEORGE: Oh, he stole it!

ELAINE: C’mon, you can’t do anything about it. The cops won’t do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don’t you just forget it?

(Jerry and George look at each other.)

JERRY & GEORGE: No.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry sits alone at a booth. George sits in the booth behind him.)

GEORGE: I thought you said one o’clock.

JERRY: Relax, he’s late. He’s always late. It’s part of his M.O.

GEORGE: Remember, don’t take any crap.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry about it.

GEORGE: I’ll be right here.

(Ray enters.)

JERRY: That’s comforting. Shh. He’s coming. (to Ray) Ray?

(Ray sits opposite Jerry.)

RAY: Oh, Jerry. I can’t believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could’ve got me into?

JERRY: Well, I didn’t...

RAY: Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.

GEORGE: (muttering to himself) I wonder why.

JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I won’t say anything.

RAY: Give it back?

JERRY: Yeah.

RAY: What are you talking about?

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: What is he talking about?

RAY: I’m talking about the statue.

JERRY: Yeah, me too.

RAY: Give it back to whom?

JERRY: Me.

GEORGE: Yeah, him.

RAY: You?

JERRY: Yeah. Me.

RAY: I’m not getting this.

GEORGE: You already got it.

JERRY: Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house – and then I saw it in your house.

RAY: What are you saying?

JERRY: What am I saying?

GEORGE: Take a wild guess.

RAY: Are you saying I stole your statue?

GEORGE: What a mind.

JERRY: Well, I...

RAY: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

JERRY: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

GEORGE: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

RAY: For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.

GEORGE: Pawn shop?

JERRY: A pawn shop?

RAY: Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people’s apartments.

GEORGE: Cleaning them out.

(Jerry elbows George in an attempt to shut him up.)

JERRY: Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.

RAY: What’s behind this? It’s Rava, isn’t it?

GEORGE: Again with the Rava.

RAY: You want her.

JERRY: No, she’s a little too cheery for me.

RAY: She’s from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!

JERRY: I know Finland. They’re neutral.

RAY: Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?

JERRY: No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...

GEORGE: “Oh, I find you so charming.” You wuss.

JERRY: (to George) Did you call me a wuss?

RAY: What did you say?

JERRY: I said luss. I’m at a luss.

RAY: I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.

JERRY: That’s not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe it’s not that bad an idea.

RAY: And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.

GEORGE: Singapore?! Do you hear this?

RAY: If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.

(George stands up and addresses Ray.)

GEORGE: That’s it! That’s it! I can’t take it. I can’t take it anymore! You stole the statue! You’re a theif! You’re a liar!

JERRY: George...

RAY: Who is this?

GEORGE: I’m the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!

RAY: What’s going on here?

GEORGE: GUILTY!

RAY: Your friend is crazy.

GEORGE: Oh, I’m crazy!

JERRY: George, george...

RAY: I’ve got to get going. I have a class.

GEORGE: Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar’s office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!

RAY: Well, that’s because I’m registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.

GEORGE: You mean alias.

RAY: You are starting to make me angry!

GEORGE: Well, that was bound to happen.

RAY: (to Jerry) I hope you think about what you’ve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.

(Ray heads for the door.)

JERRY: Hey, Ray.

(Ray stops and turns around.)

RAY: Yes?

JERRY: How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING LOBBY – DAY

(Elaine and Rava are waiting for an elevator.)

ELAINE: Nervous?

RAVA: Why should I be?

ELAINE: Yeah. Right.

RAVA: Your notes are very insightful.

ELAINE: The book is great. Did you go out last night?

RAVA: No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.

ELAINE: They all are.

RAVA: Was Jerry?

ELAINE: I can’t remember.

(The elevator doors open. They step in.)

RAVA: You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.

ELAINE: Oh, well, I’m staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.

(The elevator doors close.)



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING – LATER

(Outside the elevator, on another floor. The doors open, revealing Rava and Elaine in front of a crowd of people.)

RAVA: So you think he stole it?!

ELAINE: Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...

RAVA: I admit nothing!

(The doors close.)



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING ELEVATOR – CONTINUING

(A MAN behind them addresses Rava.)

MAN: Will you put that cigarette out, please?

(Rava ignores him.)

ELAINE: Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it’s gone and it’s in your apartment.

RAVA: Maybe you think we’re in cahoots.

ELAINE: No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.

RAVA: Yes, that’s all: a coincidence!

ELAINE: A big coincidence.

RAVA: Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!

ELAINE: No, that’s a big coincidence.

RAVA: That’s what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!

ELAINE: No, there are degrees of coincidences.

RAVA: No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone!

(Enraged, she poses the question to everyone in the elevator.)

RAVA: Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!

(Everyone just shrugs and murmurs. The doors open.)

MAN: Will you put that cigarette out?!

RAVA: Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It’s just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. You’re trying to destroy us.

ELAINE: Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?

(The doors close.)



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING – DAY

(Outside the elevator on yet another floor. The doors open. The elevator is empty except for Elaine. There is a janitor’s cart parked right outside the doors. She steps out, throws the manuscript into the garbage can on the cart and exits.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is on the phone. Elaine and Jerry are beside him. Kramer is sitting on a living room chair again.)

GEORGE: Ma, will you stop?... It’s just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didn’t even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I don’t see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesn’t react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.

KRAMER: I’m not happy about this.

ELAINE: Why don’t we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?

GEORGE: There’s just no justice. This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: (casually) Sure, why not.

ELAINE: Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.

JERRY: Can’t you talk to your boss?

ELAINE: I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think you’re funny at all.

KRAMER: (talking to himself) I’m not happy about this.

JERRY: Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..

GEORGE: Yeah, he’ll have my parents.



INT. RAVA & RAY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Ray is home alone. There’s a knock at the door.)

KRAMER: (from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!

RAY: Police?

(He opens the door a crack. Kramer barges in. He is wearing Jerry’s grandfather’s suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall face first.)

KRAMER: Freeze, mother!

(Ray turns toward Kramer.)

RAY: Hey.

(Kramer shoves him against the wall.)

KRAMER: Shut up. Spread ‘em. I said spread ‘em! (looks around) You’re in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.

(Ray turns toward Kramer.)

RAY: Murder?!

(Kramer shoves him against the wall.)

KRAMER: Shut up! Keep ‘em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!

RAY: I think you have me confused with somebody else.

KRAMER: Is your name Ray?

RAY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah, you’re the punk I’m looking for!

(Kramer grabs the statue from the mantle and puts it in his bag. Ray turns toward Kramer.)

RAY: Hey, hey, are you a cop?

KRAMER: Yeah, I’m a cop. I’m a good cop. I’m a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Today’s your lucky day, junior, ‘cause I’m gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you’ll be sorry. You got me?

RAY: Got you? I don’t even know what the hell you’re talking about.

KRAMER: Good, good. Let’s uh keep it that way.

(Kramer exits.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Kramer leads Jerry, Elaine, and George into the apartment.)

JERRY: All right, all right. What’s the big hubbub, bub?

(Kramer runs to his apartment, then returns with a duffel bag. He places it on the table, and reveals the statue from it. Everyone is Shocked)

GEORGE: Kramer, I can’t believe it. Oh, you’re my hero!

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Kramer, what did you do?

KRAMER: Well, let’s just say I didn’t take him to People’s Court.

GEORGE: I feel like a huge weight’s been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I don’t know how to thank you!

KRAMER: Well, I’ll think of something.

(Kramer slaps George on the back, knocking the statue out of his hands and sending it crashing to the ground.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You can’t stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, who’s gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can’t get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.

JERRY: Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude." 



[Office complex; Levitan's office]

LEVITAN: (on the phone) Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing) 

(George bursts into the office)

GEORGE: That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit! 



[Jerry's Apartment]

(Jerry exits his bedroom with a bag of laundry; Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey. 

JERRY: Hey. 

KRAMER: Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself. 

JERRY: Well, what'd you say? 

KRAMER: I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something. 

JERRY: What's his problem? 

KRAMER: No job. No women. 

JERRY: He called the right guy. 

KRAMER: Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him? 

JERRY: All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry. 

KRAMER: Why don't you use the machines down in the basement? 

JERRY: Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight. 

KRAMER: How 'bout if I put a few things -- 

JERRY: Wait a sec. I don't wanna do -- 

KRAMER: Well, you're going over there. 

JERRY: I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot. 

KRAMER: Have you ever met my guys? 

JERRY: No. I can't say as I have. 

KRAMER: Well! 

JERRY: All right. Put 'em on top. 

KRAMER: Ah! 

JERRY: Oh, beautiful. 



[Laundromat]

JERRY: This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine? 

VIC: I'll have to charge you for another machine. 

JERRY: Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across. 

(George shows up)

GEORGE: Guess what. 

JERRY: How did you know I was here? 

GEORGE: Kramer. Guess what. 

JERRY: I don't know. 

GEORGE: I quit my job. 

JERRY: Get outta here. 

GEORGE: I couldn't take it anymore. 

VIC: You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket)

JERRY: What happened? Levitan? 

GEORGE: I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting! 

JERRY: You and your toilets. 

GEORGE: I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs) 

JERRY: So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate? 

GEORGE: Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. 

JERRY: So what are you gonna do? 

(George realizes he's made a mistake)



[Jerry's Apartment]

GEORGE: I like sports. I could do something in sports. 

JERRY: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity? 

GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something. 

JERRY: Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. 

GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game. 

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments. 

GEORGE: What about that? 

JERRY: Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting. 

GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair. 

JERRY: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like? 

GEORGE: Movies. I like to watch movies. 

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. 

GEORGE: Do they pay people to watch movies? 

JERRY: Projectionists. 

GEORGE: That's true. 

JERRY: But you gotta know how to work the projector. 

GEORGE: Right. 

JERRY: And it's probably a union thing. 

GEORGE: (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host? 

JERRY: Talk show host. That's good. 

GEORGE: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host. 

JERRY: Really? 

GEORGE: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start? 

JERRY: Well, that's where it gets tricky. 

GEORGE: You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host." 

JERRY: I wouldn't think so. 

GEORGE: It's all politics. 

JERRY: All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else? 

GEORGE: This could have been a huge mistake. 

JERRY: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through. 

GEORGE: (sighs) Guess not. What should I do? 

JERRY: Maybe you can just go back. 

GEORGE: Go back? 

JERRY: Yeah. Pretend like it never happened. 

GEORGE: You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened? 

JERRY: Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously. 

GEORGE: Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened. 

JERRY: Never happened. 

GEORGE: I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what? 

JERRY: So what? You're entitled. 

GEORGE: I'm emotional. 

JERRY: That's right. You're emotional. 

GEORGE: Never happened. 

JERRY: Never happened. 



[Middle Monologue]

JERRY: To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."



[Office complex; Staff Meeting]

(George enters)

GEORGE: How ya doin'? 

GLENDA: What are you doing here? 

GEORGE: What? I work here. 

GLENDA: I thought you quit. 

GEORGE: What quit? (laughing) Who quit? 

DAN: Bill, how was your weekend? 

BILL: Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend? 

DAN: Fine weekend. 

GEORGE: Yeah. Good weekend. 

DAN: Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday. 

GEORGE: Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor. 

(Levitan enters; George covers his face with a folder)

LEVITAN: Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon? 

AVA: Oh, I got a little tied up. 

LEVITAN: I'll bet you did. 

(laughter breaks out in boardroom) 

LEVITAN: I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here? 

GEORGE: What? 

LEVITAN: Am I crazy, or didn't you quit? 

GEORGE: When? 

LEVITAN: Friday. 

GEORGE: Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously? 

LEVITAN: You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff? 

GEORGE: Come on. Will you stop it. 

LEVITAN: No brains? No ability? 

GEORGE: Teasing. 

LEVITAN: Okay. I want you outta here. 

GEORGE: I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?

DAN: I wouldn't say all the time.

LEVITAN: You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser. 



[Laundromat]

GEORGE: " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me. 

JERRY: Well, so that's that. 

GEORGE: No. That's not that. 

JERRY: That's not that? 

GEORGE: No. 

JERRY: Well, if that's not that, what is that? 

GEORGE: I've got some plans. I got plans. 

JERRY: What kind of plans? 

GEORGE: What's the difference? 

JERRY: You don't wanna tell me? 

GEORGE: I'm gonna slip him a mickey. 

JERRY: What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre? 

GEORGE: You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing. 

JERRY: What if you destroy him? 

GEORGE: No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over. 

JERRY: Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal. 

GEORGE: This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey! 

JERRY: You've really gone mental. 

GEORGE: Nah. 

JERRY: Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"! 

GEORGE: I got a source. 

JERRY: You got a mickey source? 

GEORGE: And Elaine is gonna keep him busy. 

JERRY: Elaine? How did you rope her into this? 

GEORGE: I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife. 

JERRY: She knew that. 

GEORGE: But she didn't know he doesn't recycle. 

JERRY: What is the point of all this? 

GEORGE: Revenge. 

JERRY: Oh, the best revenge is living well. 

GEORGE: There's no chance of that. 



[Jerry's apartment]

(Kramer enters somewhat depressed)

JERRY: Did you get your laundry? 

KRAMER: Yeah. 

JERRY: What's with you? 

KRAMER: He jumped. 

JERRY: What? 

KRAMER: Yeah. Newman jumped. 

JERRY: Did he call you last night? 

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

JERRY: What did you say? 

KRAMER: I said " Wave to me when you pass my window." 

JERRY: Whew. Did he wave? 

KRAMER: No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me. 

JERRY: (realizing something) Oh, my god! 

KRAMER: What's the matter? 

JERRY: (tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go. 

KRAMER: Where? Where? 

JERRY: To the Laundromat. 



[Laundromat]

VIC: I never saw it. 

KRAMER: Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing? 

VIC: Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying "Not Responsible for Valuables"

JERRY: Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society. 

VIC: Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution. I'm not responsible. 

JERRY: So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry? 

VIC: You ever hear of a bank? 

JERRY: Come on. Let's go. 

KRAMER: No. You can't let him get away with this. 



[Office party at the Bar]

(Elaine and George staking out the bar)

ELAINE: Which one is he? 

GEORGE: That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish. 

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I see him. 

GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this. 

ELAINE: Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison? 

GEORGE: This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done. 

ELAINE: Yeah. It is kind of cool. 

GEORGE: First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone. 

ELAINE: I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies. 

GEORGE: That's exactly what I told Jerry! 

ELAINE: Really? 

GEORGE: Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive! 



[Laundromat]

(Jerry is carrying a large bag of clothes)

JERRY: Maybe we should call this off. 

KRAMER: Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine. 

JERRY: And what's gonna happen? 

KRAMER: Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block! 

JERRY: If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor. 

KRAMER: You keep him busy. 

(Kramer, holding heavy bag of concrete in arms, stumbles to machine, knocking chairs around) 

(Kramer plops concrete down onto washing machine) 

KRAMER: Whoa! 

(lifting bag into the air, Kramer, thrown off balance, stumbles backwards and slams into the dryer) 



[Office party at the Bar]

(George and Elaine are in the corner talking)

GEORGE: You go over there - 

ELAINE: Yeah. 

GEORGE: You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink. 

ELAINE: Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth? 

(George motions for her to do it. Elaine walks over to where Levitan is sitting)

LEVITAN: Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield. 

ELAINE: Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me. 

LEVITAN: Yeah. 

GREENY: I'm gonna get some food. You want some? 

LEVITAN: Nah. 

ELAINE: Hi. 

LEVITAN: Hi. 

ELAINE: (sneezes) 

LEVITAN: God bless you. 

ELAINE: Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou! 

LEVITAN: (confused) You're welcome. 

ELAINE: People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that? 

LEVITAN: No. 

ELAINE: (having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week. 

LEVITAN: (interested) Nudist colony? 

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah! 

LEVITAN: (laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony. 

ELAINE: Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked. 

LEVITAN: Seriously? 

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. 

(George makes his move; Glenda is occupying the seat next to Levitan)

GEORGE: (whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat? 

GLENDA: (loud) What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats. 

GEORGE: (whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here. 

GLENDA: (loud) What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired. 

GEORGE: (whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine. 

ELAINE: I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked. 

LEVITAN: Who are you? 

ELAINE: Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble. 



[Laundromat]

(Back to Kramer after hitting the dryer; Picks up the concrete makes his way back to the washer; opens the lid on the machine, it slams shut forcing Kramer to pour the concrete all over the machine)

JERRY: (trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? 

(opening lid, Kramer begins to contort & flail arms about as a cloud of concrete covers his face) 

JERRY: Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle? 

(Kramer emptying bag into machine) 

JERRY: What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament? 

(finished with machine, Kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag & drops it on the floor) 

(Kramer giving "OK" sign) 

(Kramer starting machine & trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of the machine) 

JERRY: What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks? 

(Kramer walks over to where Jerry is standing, his entire body covered with dry concrete) 

KRAMER: I didn't realize it was a full box. 



[Office party; Bar]

GEORGE: (trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off. 

GLENDA: I don't' wear a wig. 

GEORGE: One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)

ELAINE: No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around. 

(Levitan & Elaine laughing) 

ELAINE: I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra. 

(George empties contents of tiny bottle into Levitan's drink) 

(Elaine & Levitan laughing) 

GEORGE: Hello, Rick. 

LEVITAN: Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here! 

GEORGE: That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! 

LEVITAN: You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man. 

GEORGE: Oh! 

LEVITAN: I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap. 

GEORGE: Boom! 

(all laughing) 

LEVITAN: You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh? 

GEORGE: Oh. 

LEVITAN: Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back. (George is shocked) You can use my bathroom anytime you want. 

GEORGE: You want me to come back? Uh... 

LEVITAN: Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast! 

GEORGE: Rick. 

LEVITAN: Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties. 

GEORGE: Uh, Rick.. 

LEVITAN: And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that possible.. 

GEORGE: Rick. 

LEVITAN: I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this? 

GEORGE: Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)



[Jerry's Apartment]

(George is sitting at the coffee table; Jerry and Elaine on the couch)

GEORGE: I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something. 

ELAINE: Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree. 

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: Yeah. That's true. 

KRAMER: (seeing Jerry is with people) Oh.

JERRY: What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it? 

KRAMER: It was in my laundry. 

JERRY: In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be? 

KRAMER: It was about 1200 bucks. 

NEWMAN: Kramer! 

KRAMER: Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)

NEWMAN: I'm on the roof! 

KRAMER: (yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for? 

JERRY: Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money.. 

(Elaine and Jerry leave)

GEORGE: (talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy. 

KRAMER: You wanna shoot some pool tonight? 

NEWMAN: I can't. I'm goin' to a movie. 

GEORGE: (talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing. 


[Closing Monologue]

JERRY: People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'

JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV)

TV VOICE: (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..

(Jerry's now asleep)

[Setting: Jerry's bedroom]

(Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his head, then goes back to sleep, laughing to himself)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Coffee shop]

(Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)

ELAINE: What do you got, a cucumber?

GEORGE: Yeah, so what?

ELAINE: You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?

GEORGE: They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.

JERRY: (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.

(Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?

ELAINE: No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."

JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?

ELAINE: (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?

GEORGE: Let me see that. (Studies the note)

ELAINE: Hey, where's Kramer?

JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"

GEORGE: (Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.

JERRY: I don't think that's it.

GEORGE: I'm not kidding.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.

JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.

GEORGE: Tightness..

JERRY: C'mon.

GEORGE: Shortness of breath..

JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous.

GEORGE: Radiating waves of pain..

JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.

GEORGE: There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.

JERRY: (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.

GEORGE: Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.

JERRY: So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?

GEORGE: Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.

JERRY: I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)

(A waitress approaches. George is dying, but the waitress doesn't seem to notice)

WAITRESS: Is everything alright?

GEORGE: We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..

ELAINE: George!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Hospital room]

(George lies in the bed. He has EKG cups on his chest, a tube up his nose, and an IV in his arm. The man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain)

MAN: Ooohhh... Argghhh..

GEORGE: Are.. are you okay?

MAN: Ooooooohhh..

GEORGE: I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-

MAN: Shut up!

(Scene goes to Jerry. He's standing at the doorway, showing the note to a nurse)

JERRY: Well? What do you think?

NURSE 1: "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.

JERRY: "Salami salami bologna"?

DOCTOR: (In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?

GEORGE: No, no thanks.

JERRY: (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?

GEORGE: Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.

JERRY: Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..

GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.

JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..

JERRY: Well, you know..

GEORGE: (Reluctantly) Well, okay.

JERRY: Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?

GEORGE: Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..

JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.

GEORGE: I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?

JERRY: You know, if your future was a little more certain..

GEORGE: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.

JERRY: Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)

GEORGE: What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!

(Elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George)

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Jerk off.

(Jerry goes over to Elaine)

JERRY: (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.

(They both go to George's bed. Elaine decides to go along with Jerry's joke)

ELAINE: Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?

(Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George)

GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!

(The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance)

DOCTOR: (To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.

DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.

GEORGE: (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!

DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack.

GEORGE: (Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?

DOCTOR: No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.

GEORGE: Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.

DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far.

GEORGE: (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!

DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?

GEORGE: My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.

DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)

DOCTOR: It happens.

JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.

ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.

DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.

JERRY: (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.

GEORGE: (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!

DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.

GEORGE: What? You mean with a knife?

DOCTOR: Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.

GEORGE: (Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.

DOCTOR: Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.

ELAINE: (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)

JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.

(Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.

JERRY: (Trying to shut him up) Kramer.

KRAMER: The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.

JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.

KRAMER: No? That's good.

GEORGE: I have to have my tonsils taken out.

KRAMER: Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.

JERRY: (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.

KRAMER: Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..

GEORGE: Well, what should I do, Kramer?

JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him.

KRAMER: I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.

JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time?

KRAMER: No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.

JERRY: A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.

KRAMER: He's holistic, George. He's holistic.

GEORGE: Holistic.. that sounds right.

JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?

JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.

GEORGE: Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?

KRAMER: First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Healer's apartment]

(Jerry and George are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor. Kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model)

GEORGE: So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?

JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.

GEORGE: All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.

JERRY: (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.

GEORGE: Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?

(Tor enters. He hugs Kramer for a long time, then walks over to Jerry and George)

TOR: (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?

JERRY: Sorry.

(Tor sits down, and turns tward George)

TOR: What month were you born?

GEORGE: April.

TOR: You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.

GEORGE: Really?

TOR: Do you use hot water in the shower?

GEORGE: Yes.

TOR: Stop using it.

GEORGE: ..Okay.

KRAMER: I'm off hot water.

TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.

GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.

TOR: (Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.

GEORGE: (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?

TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.

JERRY: (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.

GEORGE: (Still on the hot water) What about shaving?

TOR: (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)

GEORGE: I guess so.

TOR: (Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.

JERRY: (Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..

TOR: You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.

GEORGE: (Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?

JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Doctor's car]

(The Doctor and Elaine are almost done with their date. the doctor is speaking seductively to Elaine while holding out her tongue)

DOCTOR: ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..

(The Doctor is still holding her tongue)

ELAINE: Uh-huh.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Healer's apartment]

TOR: (Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.

JERRY: I love crampbark.

TOR: Cleavers.

JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.

TOR: And some couchgrass.

JERRY: Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.

(Tor hands George the tea. George isn't willing to drink it right away. Jerry looks skeptical, Kramer, on the other hand, is enthusiastic)

KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-

TOR: (Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. "Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)

KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

GEORGE: (Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Ambulance]

(George's strapped down on a gurney. His face is purple, and he's screaming. Jerry and Kramer are trying to calm him down. The driver and the assistant in the back are having a huge fight)

GEORGE: (In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!

DRIVER: (To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!

ASSISTANT: I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!

DRIVER: I don't even like Chuckles!

JERRY: (To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.

GEORGE: My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!

ASSISTANT: I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!

JERRY: (To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?

ASSISTANT: (Angry, to Driver) Pull over!

DRIVER: Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!

ASSISTANT: Yeah!

JERRY: You're gonna fight?

GEORGE: Now?! I'm a mutant!

KRAMER: (To Driver) Hey, let me drive.

ASSISTANT: Come on, man. Pull over!

DRIVER: Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!

(Ambulance comes to a screeching halt. Driver gets out, and the assistant heads for the back door)

JERRY: (Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.

GEORGE: My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!

ASSISTANT: I'm gonna kick his ass.

KRAMER: (To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?

GEORGE: You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!

(The Assistant leaves. Jerry, Kramer, and George watch the two fight)

JERRY: All this for a Chuckle.

KRAMER: What's a Chuckle?

JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Doctor's car]

(He's still holding Elaine's tongue)

DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.

ELAINE: Can you let go of my tongue now?

DOCTOR: What?

ELAINE: Let go of my tongue!

DOCTOR: (Lets go) Oh, sorry.

ELAINE: Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?

DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night.

ELAINE: A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Ambulance]

(It's now moving. The driver's behind the wheel, but the assistant is nowhere in sight)

JERRY: You just can't leave him out there.

DRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up.

KRAMER: Well, can you call him an ambulance?

DRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!

KRAMER: hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!

DRIVER: (Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!

JERRY AND KRAMER: Watch out!

(The Ambulance crashes into something)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Hospital room]

(George is in the bed, watching TV, wearing a neck brace. Jerry enters limping and wearing a neck brace, also. He talks to George, but George can't respond verbally)

JERRY: How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.

(Nurse enters)

JERRY: Hey, check the TV.

(The TV is showing the same exact movie Jerry was watching at the start of the show)

TV VOICE: (Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..

JERRY: (Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.

MAN IN NEIGHBORING BED: Shut up!

(George throws the whole carton of ice cream over the separating curtan)

MAN: Aaahhhgggg!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"

I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, "What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.



[While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.]

JERRY: What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?

ELAINE: Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?

JERRY: He was good in Man From Uncle.

ELAINE: Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?

JERRY: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.

ELAINE: Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.

JERRY: No, I don't wanna see the naked people.

ELAINE: Been a while?

JERRY: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.

ELAINE: I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.

JERRY: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What was that look?

JERRY: What look?

ELAINE: The look you just gave me.

JERRY: I gave a look?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: What kind of look?

ELAINE: I know that look.

JERRY: Then what was it?

ELAINE: Why should I tell you?

JERRY: Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.

ELAINE: Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What about the look?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: You got something on your mind?

JERRY: No. Things pop into your head. You?

ELAINE: Things occur to me from time to time.

JERRY: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.

ELAINE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?

ELAINE: Thirty-seven.

JERRY: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)

ELAINE: We know the terrain.

JERRY: No big surprises.

ELAINE: Nope.

JERRY: What do you think?

ELAINE: I don't know. What do you think?

JERRY: Well, it's something to consider.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: I mean, let's say we did.

ELAINE: What if.

JERRY: Is that like the end of the world or something?

ELAINE: Certainly not.

JERRY: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.

ELAINE: It's almost stupid if we didn't.

JERRY: It's moronic.

ELAINE: Absurd!

JERRY: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.

ELAINE: We, there are always a few.

JERRY: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.

ELAINE: Devastating.

JERRY: Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)

ELAINE: And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)

JERRY: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.

ELAINE: Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.

JERRY: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.

ELAINE: Huh.

JERRY: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.

ELAINE: Right.

JERRY: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.

ELAINE: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.

JERRY: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.

ELAINE: All right, sir.

JERRY: Now here's another little rule.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.

ELAINE: Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!

JERRY: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.

ELAINE: What about the kiss goodnight?

JERRY: Tough one. You're call.

ELAINE: It's brug-wa (?).

JERRY: Fine. Well.

ELAINE: Well.

JERRY: You ready?

ELAINE: Ready.

JERRY: So think you can handle this?

ELAINE: Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)



[Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Got the paper?

JERRY: Not yet.

KRAMER: No paper?

JERRY: I haven't been out yet.

KRAMER: Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)



[George and Jerry at Monk's.]

GEORGE: What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?

JERRY: No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?

GEORGE: Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?

JERRY: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.

GEORGE: Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.

JERRY: I thought you'd like that.

GEORGE: Oh, this is huge!

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: All right, okay. Let's go, details.

JERRY: No, I can't do details.

GEORGE: You wha?

JERRY: I can't give details.

GEORGE: No details?

JERRY: I'm not in the mood.

GEORGE: You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!

JERRY: All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.

GEORGE: Where are you sitting?

JERRY: On the couch.

GEORGE: Next to each other?

JERRY: No, separated.

GEORGE: Time?

JERRY: Around eleven.

GEORGE: Okay, go ahead.

JERRY: So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.

GEORGE: Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.

JERRY: And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.

GEORGE: Boy, these are really bad details.

JERRY: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.

GEORGE: Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.

JERRY: Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.

GEORGE: Better than before?

JERRY: She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.

GEORGE: This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?

JERRY: Not exactly.

GEORGE: Not exactly. What does that mean?

JERRY: Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)

GEORGE: Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
(He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.

JERRY: I think we've worked out a system.

GEORGE: Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.

JERRY: No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.

GEORGE: Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.

JERRY: Okay. No calls the next day.

GEORGE: (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.

JERRY: You ready for the second one?

GEORGE: I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.

JERRY: Spending the night. Optional.

GEORGE: No, you see? You got greedy.

JERRY: No, that's the rule. It's optional.

GEORGE: I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.

JERRY: I think you're wrong.

GEORGE: I hope I am.



[At Elaine's apartment, Jerry opens the fridge and pulls out a piece of cake.]

JERRY: Is this yours or the roommate's?

ELAINE: The roommate's.

JERRY: Would she mind?

ELAINE: She keeps track of everything.

JERRY: Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.

ELAINE: Thanks.

JERRY: Well, guess I'll get going.

ELAINE: Oh.

JERRY: Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.

ELAINE: Fine, go away.

JERRY: I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.

ELAINE: Just go.

JERRY: I'm having surgery tomorrow.

ELAINE: Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.

JERRY: But you said, it can be very serious.

ELAINE: Okay, so fine. Go.

JERRY: What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.

ELAINE: Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.

JERRY: It has nothing to do with whose house it is.

ELAINE: Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)

Tina: Hi.

Elaine + JERRY: Hi.

Tina: Hi, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi.

Tina: Such a great improv class tonight.

ELAINE: Oh really?

Tina: I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.

ELAINE: Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?

Tina: Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)

ELAINE: What are you doing?

JERRY: I can't go if you're mad.

ELAINE: I'm not mad.

JERRY: You seemed a little mad.

ELAINE: No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.

JERRY: So you're okay with everything?

ELAINE: Definitely. Are you?

JERRY: Definitely. Well, goodnight.

ELAINE: Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Rules.

Tina: Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)



[Jerry and George are at the store.]

GEORGE: What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.

JERRY: No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.

GEORGE: Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.

JERRY: No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.

GEORGE: What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?

JERRY: You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.

GEORGE: What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.

JERRY: I think I heard her say something about a bench.

GEORGE: A bench? What kind of a bench?

JERRY: I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.

GEORGE: What, like at a bus stop?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: Like a park bench?

JERRY: I have no idea.

GEORGE: Who puts a bench in their house?

JERRY: Forget the bench.

GEORGE: I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?

JERRY: No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.

GEORGE: Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.

JERRY: Nice looking fellow.

GEORGE: What about candle holders?

JERRY: Too romantic.

GEORGE: Lingerie?

JERRY: Too sexual.

GEORGE: Waffle maker.

JERRY: Too domestic.

GEORGE: Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.

JERRY: Too Gubernatorial. (?)

GEORGE: Let's work on the card.


[Jerry and Elaine sitting on his couch. Elaine holding a present.]

JERRY: Maybe you won't like it.

ELAINE: Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.

JERRY: You could not like it.

ELAINE: Just the fact that you remembered means everything.

JERRY: Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)

ELAINE: Cash?

JERRY: Would do you think?

ELAINE: You got me cash?

JERRY: Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?

ELAINE: Who are you, my uncle?

JERRY: Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.

ELAINE: Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)

ELAINE: Pal? You think I'm your pal?

JERRY: I said, "and more."

ELAINE: I am not your pal.

JERRY: What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)

ELAINE: Oh, what is this? You got me something?

KRAMER: Yeah. Open it.

ELAINE: Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)

KRAMER: That's pretty good, huh?

JERRY: Great.

KRAMER: Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.

JERRY: Well goody for you.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?

JERRY: 182 bucks.

KRAMER: Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.

ELAINE: (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.

KRAMER: (To Jerry) Yates.

ELAINE: Oh Kramer. (They embrace)

JERRY: Could you excuse us please?

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: We're talking.

KRAMER: Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)

JERRY: You know, we never had one fight before this deal.

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: Never.

ELAINE: Ever.

JERRY: We got along beautifully.

ELAINE: Like clams.

JERRY: It was wonderful.

ELAINE: A pleasure.

JERRY: So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.

ELAINE: I can't do it.

JERRY: You what?

ELAINE: I can't do that.

JERRY: You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?

ELAINE: This, that, and the other.

JERRY: Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?

ELAINE: You.

JERRY: (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...


[Jerry and George at Monk's.]

GEORGE: Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.

JERRY: I never should have made up those rules.

GEORGE: What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?

JERRY: It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.

GEORGE: You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.

JERRY: What did you end up giving her?

GEORGE: 91 dollars.

JERRY: Sorry about that.

GEORGE: So what're you gonna do?

JERRY: Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.

GEORGE: So, maybe this should be it.

JERRY: Could be it.

GEORGE: She seems like an it.

JERRY: She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...

GEORGE: We'd have to kill him.

JERRY: We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.

GEORGE: I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.

JERRY: Plus, you know what else.

GEORGE: You better call her.


[Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: You got the paper yet?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?

ELAINE: No.

KRAMER: Well, you're not reading it now.

ELAINE: All right, you can take it. But I want it back.

KRAMER: Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?

ELAINE: Ah, this. And that.

JERRY: And the other.

KRAMER: Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple.

JERRY: Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Coffee shop]

GEORGE: (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.

JERRY: She's the performance artist, right?

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.

JERRY: What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?

ELAINE: Todd.

JERRY: Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.

ELAINE: No, he's not.

JERRY: C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.

ELAINE: By marriage.

JERRY: Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.

GEORGE: That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.

ELAINE: Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

GEORGE: What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?

JERRY: Thin ice, George. Thin ice..

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.

ELAINE: She stopped performing.

GEORGE: (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.

JERRY: (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

GEORGE: She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".

JERRY: Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?

GEORGE: God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.

ELAINE: It was an accident!

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"

JERRY: (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.

GEORGE: And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.

JERRY: What ever happened with the shirt?

GEORGE: I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.

ELAINE: I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.

JERRY: Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?

ELAINE: anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.

GEORGE: Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.

JERRY: Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.

GEORGE: (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.

ELAINE: Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..

GEORGE: She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!

ELAINE: (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.

GEORGE: Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.

ELAINE: See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..

JERRY: But?

ELAINE: My roommate has Lyme disease.

JERRY: Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?

ELAINE: She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.

JERRY: How did she get Lyme disease?

ELAINE: I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.

JERRY: They still do that play?

ELAINE: It's a classic.

JERRY: With all the nudity?

ELAINE: I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.

GEORGE: (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!

JERRY: Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.

ELAINE: What do you wanna know?

JERRY: Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?

ELAINE: Rarely.

JERRY: There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: When is this suppose to be?

ELAINE: Saturday.

JERRY: Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?

ELAINE: I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.

JERRY: 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.

GEORGE: Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.

JERRY: And if you do?

GEORGE: I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's TV's not giving a clear picture. He messes with the dials as Kramer looks over his shoulder)

KRAMER: What are you doing this for? Look at you..

JERRY: Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.

KRAMER: But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.

JERRY: (Pleading) Leave me alone.

KRAMER: It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!

JERRY: I'm not getting illegal cable!

KRAMER: Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.

JERRY: No, I read in the paper..

KRAMER: (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..

JERRY: Well, they might hook us up again.

KRAMER: Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!

JERRY: Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.

KRAMER: Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!

JERRY: What you're suggesting is illegal.

KRAMER: It's not illegal.

JERRY: It's against the law.

KRAMER: Well, yeah.

JERRY: (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?

KRAMER: (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.

JERRY: A real human rights nut, huh?

KRAMER: Yeah. He's intense, man.

JERRY: I don't know. What if I get caught?

KRAMER: Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.

(Kramer drops the rabbit ears, and goes to his apartment. He then returns with a Russian cable guy - Anatoly Tabachnick, and his assistant. Tabachnick mumbles, shakes, laughs, then wanders around the apartment. Jerry looks confused)

JERRY: You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.

TABACHNICK: Tomarrow okay.

KRAMER: No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.

JERRY: (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..

KRAMER: No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..

JERRY: (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.

KRAMER: You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry enters carrying luggage. A group of nem in suits are waiting for him)

MAN: Mr. Steinfeld?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

MAN: We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?

JERRY: My cable hook-up? What about it?

MAN: It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.

JERRY: It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?

(An agent leads Kramer out of the bedroom into the living room)

KRAMER: Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.

MAN: You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.

JERRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.

(Tabachnick steps out of the bedroom. He's dressed like the other FBI men, and speaks without an accent now)

TABACHNICK: Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.

(Jerry looks around for an excape, then makes a mad dash for the door)

KRAMER: No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Airplane]

(Jerry shudders when looking back on his dream. A stewardess approaches)

JERRY: Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?

STEWARDESS: I'm afraid not.

JERRY: What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?

STEWARDESS: No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?

(The passenger, Bill, next to him offers his hand)

BILL: My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."

(Scene ends)



[Setting: George's car]

(George is driving while wearing an unzipped coat, and a sweater with a bright red collar under it. Jerry's riding shotgun)

GEORGE: Sounds like a rough trip.

JERRY: Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.

GEORGE: So, the college cancelled the gig?

JERRY: Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.

GEORGE: (Modestly) Forget it.

JERRY: No, really.. an airport run.

GEORGE: It's nothing.

JERRY: Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.

JERRY: (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.

GEORGE: (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.

JERRY: Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.

GEORGE: (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.

GEORGE: My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.

JERRY: You want to get a bite?

GEORGE: Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.

JERRY: Well, so what should we do?

GEORGE: Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?

(Jerry's suddenly suspicious. He notices George's red collar, then reaches over and pulls the sweater down)

JERRY: Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!

GEORGE: (Nervous) What are you talking about?

JERRY: You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

GEORGE: I am? What a strange coincidence..

JERRY: A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..

GEORGE: (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.

JERRY: What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?

GEORGE: No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Leslie is talking to a group of people, including Elaine)

LESLIE: We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.

ELAINE: So, where's Todd?

LESLIE: Up in Hyannisport.

ELAINE: Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!

WOMAN: (To Leslie) So, when's your due date?

LESLIE: March twentieth, nine a.m.

WOMAN: You know the time!

LESLIE: I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.

ELAINE: Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?

LESLIE: (Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

(Kramer bursts through the door, followed by Tabachnick and his assistant. Tabachnick looks over a woman, and nods approvingly. The woman freeze at the sight, then disperse nervously)

ELAINE: (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?

KRAMER: We're putting in cable.

ELAINE: The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!

KRAMER: Oh, we have to do this now.

(Tabachnick and his assistant are leering at the women)

ELAINE: Who's this guy?

KRAMER: Which one?

ELAINE: Both of the them.

KRAMER: Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.

ELAINE: Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?

KRAMER: Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.

ELAINE: You can't! You can't do this now!

KRAMER: Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.

ELAINE: Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.

KRAMER: (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: George's car]

JERRY: And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?

GEORGE: (Boiling) What am I going to say?!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!

JERRY: You'll never say that to her face.

GEORGE: Watch me.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.

ELAINE: (To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?

(Tabachnick and his assistant start to argue, then they start fighting)

ELAINE: Kramer!

KRAMER: (Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..

(Everyone's watching the fight. Kramer breaks it up. Tabachnick walks to the bathroom while his assistant returns to work. Tabachnick bangs on the door, and shouts in Russian. A woman finally gets out. Tabachnick gets into the bathroom and slams the door shut. Jerry and George enter. Elaine runs up to greet them)

ELAINE: What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.

JERRY: The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.

ELAINE: I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.

(Leslie approaches them)

LESLIE: Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town.

JERRY: Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.

ELAINE: (Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!

GEORGE: (Unconvincingly coy) About what?

TABACHNICK: (Sticks his head out the door) Kramer, Kramer, Kramer..

(Kramer rushes over, and quickly closes the bathroom door as Tabachnick joins his assistant at the food table. George is ready for Leslie - he takes off his sweater, revealing the chocolate stain. He walks over to Leslie)

GEORGE: Leslie.

LESLIE: Yeah?

GEORGE: George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.

LESLIE: Hi.

GEORGE: (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?

LESLIE: Vaguely.

GEORGE: You took me to one of your shows..

LESLIE: And?

GEORGE: And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..

(Scene cuts to Jerry)

MARY: Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me?

JERRY: I'm sorry, I..

MARY: (Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.

JERRY: (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..

MARY: Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.

JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..

MARY: Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!

JERRY: No, I don't think that..

MARRY: Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!

(She feigns, spitting on the floor near Jerry's shoes, and storms out. Scene cuts to George. Leslie's bored to death)

GEORGE: Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..

(Mary runs for the door, pushing Leslie into George. Her chocolate cake is now all over George's shirt)

LESLIE: Thanks a lot!

(Scene cuts to the front door. Elaine is saying goodbye to a few women who are rushing out the door)

ELAINE: I'm sorry you have to go.

WOMAN: Yeah. I really have to be going.

(Scene cuts to Jerry. He notices the cable guys)

JERRY: Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.

KRAMER: Don't be a fool.

TABACHNICK: You don't want?

JERRY: No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..

TABACHNICK: (Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!

(Scene cuts to Elaine by the door. Leslie has her coat on, and is ready to leave)

LESLIE: I'm going.. obviously.

ELAINE: Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..

LESLIE: Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.

ELAINE: (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?

LESLIE: (Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go!

(George comes out from the bedroom, carrying all the shower gifts - embarrassed)

GEORGE: (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)

JERRY: (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's TV screen is cracked. George and Elaine are slumped on chairs)

GEORGE: Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?

ELAINE: Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.

JERRY: Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?

KRAMER: (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."

JERRY: (A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"



[Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant]

ELAINE: No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.

GEORGE: Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.

JERRY: I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.

ELAINE: You should run for mayor.

JERRY: Ehh, nobody listens.

ELAINE: Where is someone? I'm starving.

GEORGE: I think this is him right here.

ELAINE: Is there a table ready?

RESTAURANT MANAGER (BRUCE): How many?

ELAINE (to Jerry): How many?

JERRY (to George): Is Tatiana coming?

GEORGE: I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.

JERRY: Really? I thought things were going OK.

GEORGE: They were, it's kinda complicated.

JERRY: Well what is it?

ELAINE: How many?

JERRY: Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.

BRUCE: Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.

GEORGE: What do you wanna do?

ELAINE: Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.

JERRY: We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.

GEORGE: I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?

JERRY (to Elaine): Tatiana...

(George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)

GEORGE: Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?

(guy on phone just turns the other way without answering)

BRUCE: Lashbrook, 4!

JERRY: So did I do a terrible thing?

ELAINE: You mean lying to your uncle?

JERRY: I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!

GEORGE (to Jerry): You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.

ELAINE: Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.

JERRY: Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.

GEORGE: He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.

ELAINE: Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?

JERRY: Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.

ELAINE: Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.

GEORGE: I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?

(Jerry stares at someone)

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?

ELAINE: I've never seen her before.

JERRY: I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.

(a group of people comes in, one of them bumps into Elaine)

MAN: Oh, Excuse me.

ELAINE: I'm sorry.

(the group just walks right into the dining room)

ELAINE: Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.

JERRY: Well maybe they were here from before.

ELAINE: No no no, they weren't here before.

GEORGE (to guy): Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.

(guy on phone turns away again)

ELAINE: Find out what's going on!

JERRY: Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.

ELAINE: Yeah.

BRUCE: What's your name?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

(Bruce starts talking to a Chinese woman in Chinese)

BRUCE: No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!

ELAINE: Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.

JERRY: Boy, you are really hungry.

GEORGE (whistles to guy on phone): Hey!

(guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, goes over to Jerry)

GEORGE: If anything happens here, can I count on you?

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: If we decide to go at it.

JERRY: Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...

GEORGE: I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.

ELAINE: I'm gonna faint...

JERRY: George, who is that woman in the stripes?

GEORGE: I don't know her.

JERRY: She looks so familiar.

ELAINE: Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.

JERRY: I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.

ELAINE: What do you mean?

JERRY: You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.

GEORGE: What are they gonna do?

JERRY: They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.

ELAINE: 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?

JERRY: 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.

ELAINE: OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...

JERRY: No, no tricks.

ELAINE: Should I do it, George?

GEORGE: For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.

(Elaine goes over to the table, smiling)

ELAINE (through her teeth): I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.

(the people at the table are confused)

ELAINE (through teeth): I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

PEOPLE AT TABLE: What? What is she talking about? What did she say?

(Elaine runs from the table, laughing)

JERRY: What happened?

ELAINE: Did you see that?

GEORGE: What were you doing?

ELAINE (laughing): I offered them 25, they had no idea...

JERRY: George, the phone's free.

GEORGE: Alleluia.

(as George reaches for the phone, a woman snatches it and starts dialing)

GEORGE: Excuse me, I was waiting here.

WOMAN AT PHONE: Where? I didn't see you.

GEORGE: I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!

WOMAN: Well I won't be long.

GEORGE: That's not the point. The point is I was here first.

WOMAN: Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.

GEORGE (yelling at her): You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.

(he goes over to Jerry and Elaine)

GEORGE: Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!

(guy on phone approaches George)

GUY: Hey, sorry I took so long.

GEORGE: Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.

ELAINE: How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.

JERRY: I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?

GEORGE: Yeah, well, he probably bought it.

JERRY: So what happened with Tatiana?

GEORGE: I shouldn't even tell you this.

JERRY: Come on...

GEORGE: Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.

JERRY: I'm with you.

GEORGE: Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...

JERRY: This could only happen to you.

GEORGE: So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".

JERRY: You said this to her after.

GEORGE: No. During.

JERRY: Oh, boy.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Wow! So...?

GEORGE: So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's

(gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.

(Elaine comes over)

ELAINE: I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.

JERRY (still trying to remember): Who is that woman?!

ELAINE: Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.

GEORGE: She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)

ELAINE: Jerry, talk to that guy again.

JERRY: What am I gonna say?

ELAINE: Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.

(as Jerry approaches Bruce, a man walks in)

MR. COHEN: Hey, what stinks in here?

Bruce (laughing): Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.

MR. COHEN: Well, I've been looking for a better place.

(Bruce laughs)

BRUCE: Better place... Want a table?

MR. COHEN: No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.

BRUCE (laughing): Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table.

JERRY: Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.

BRUCE: Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.

ELAINE: He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?

BRUCE: Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.

ELAINE: Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!

GEORGE: She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.

JERRY: Didja leave a message?

GEORGE: Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.

ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...

JERRY: Where do I know her?

(woman in stripes approaches Jerry)

LORRAINE: Hello, Jerry!

JERRY: Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?

LORRAINE: How is everything?

JERRY: Good, good, good... What's goin' on?

LORRAINE: Oh, working hard. And you?

JERRY: Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.

LORRAINE: You haven't been around in a while.

JERRY: I know, I know... Well, you know.

LORRAINE: You should come by.

JERRY: Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.

ELAINE: Hi, I'm Elaine.

LORRAINE (shaking her hand): Lorraine. Catalano.

JERRY: I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...

(They all laugh, then silent)

LORRAINE: Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she leaves)

ELAINE (smug): Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!

JERRY: Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.

ELAINE: The one you broke the plans with tonight?

JERRY: Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...

JERRY: ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.

ELAINE: You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.

JERRY: Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!

(Elaine nods)

JERRY: Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.

ELAINE: Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.

JERRY: In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?

ELAINE: Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.

GEORGE: 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?

ELAINE: Well what do you want to give him, change?

GEORGE: It's more than the meal!

JERRY: Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.

GEORGE: Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!

JERRY: I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?

GEORGE: Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.

ELAINE: I guess it's you, Jer.

JERRY: Me? What about you?

ELAINE: Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.

JERRY: The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?

ELAINE: Give me the money.

(Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention)

ELAINE: How's it going'?

BRUCE: Very busy.

(Elaine holds the money in front of Bruce)

ELAINE: Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.

BRUCE: Very good specials tonight.

(Elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book)

ELAINE: If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.

BRUCE: What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)

ELAINE: No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)

BRUCE: Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.

ELAINE (Gives him the money): Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!

(Bruce shrugs and takes it)

BRUCE: Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.

ELAINE: No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.

JERRY: You lost the 20.

ELAINE: Well, how could he do that?

GEORGE: You didn't make it clear.

ELAINE: Make it clear?

JERRY: What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.

(goes over to Bruce) Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely embarrassing, my friend here apparently made a mistake.

BRUCE: Your name?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

BRUCE: Yeah, Seinfeld 4!

JERRY: No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?

(Elaine waves at him, smiling)

BRUCE: Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?

JERRY: Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.

BRUCE: Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-

JERRY: Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?

BRUCE: Oh. In about five, ten minutes.

(Jerry goes over to Elaine and George)

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.

ELAINE: So when are we gonna eat?

JERRY: Five, ten minutes.

GEORGE: We should have left earlier. I told you.

JERRY: I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.

ELAINE: Oh, well I have to eat.

JERRY: Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.

ELAINE: Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?

JERRY: We'll eat it in the movie.

ELAINE: Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?

JERRY: Well what do you suggest?

ELAINE: I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.

JERRY: I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.

BRUCE (holding a phone): Cartwright?

ELAINE: I can't have popcorn for dinner!

BRUCE: Cartwright?

ELAINE (tries to snatch food off a waiter's tray): I have to eat!

JERRY: So they have hotdogs there.

ELAINE: Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.

GEORGE: I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.

(goes over to Bruce)

GEORGE: Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

BRUCE: Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up.

GEORGE: Well, was it for Costanza or...

BRUCE: Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.

GEORGE: Well was it a woman?

BRUCE: Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.

(George comes over to Jerry and Elaine, stunned)

GEORGE: She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.

JERRY: Who's Cartwright?

GEORGE: I'm Cartwright!

JERRY: You're not Cartwri-

GEORGE: Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.

ELAINE: Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.

JERRY: So You're not going?

ELAINE: You don't need us.

JERRY: Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

GEORGE: Should we tell him we're leaving?

ELAINE: What for? Let's just get out of here.

(they all leave)

BRUCE: Seinfeld, 4?



[closing monologue]

JERRY: Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"

JERRY: I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: A restaurant]

(Jerry, George, and Elaine are all eating at an Italian restaurant. George hasn't eaten anything)

ELAINE: Do you want some of mine?

JERRY: Take some of mine.

GEORGE: Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.

JERRY: Who said you have to like it?

GEORGE: Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.

JERRY: I don't like pesto.

GEORGE: Where was pesto 10 years ago?

JERRY: (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.

ELAINE: (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.

(George has started eating Elaine's food - and continues to do so)

JERRY: (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.

GEORGE: That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.

JERRY: I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.

GEORGE: A guy?

ELAINE: (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.

JERRY: He's from a.. Yakima, right?

ELAINE: Seattle.

JERRY: Everybody's moving to Seattle.

GEORGE: It's the pesto of cities. So..?

ELAINE: (To Jerry) You tell him.

JERRY: Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.

ELAINE: Ed.

JERRY: Who was in town on a business venture, and um..

ELAINE: ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.

JERRY: So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.

ELAINE: On some people.

GEORGE: Oooh.

JERRY: So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.

ELAINE: It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.

(The menu at a neighboring table catches fire. Elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out, but George tosses the menu on the floor, and stomps it out. The manager approaches)

MANAGER: What happened?

GEORGE: Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.

MANAGER: Sorry to the disturbance.

ELAINE: (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.

(Manager leaves)

JERRY: (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.

GEORGE: Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!

ELAINE: I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.

JERRY: (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.

(The busboy takes of his apron, throws it down, and exits the restaurant)

GEORGE: I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!

ELAINE: Oh, I said it in a kidding way.

GEORGE: I didn't know he'd get fired.

JERRY: (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.

GEORGE: What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!

JERRY: (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.

GEORGE: Was it my fault?

ELAINE: Was it my fault?

JERRY: (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.

GEORGE: (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.

JERRY: Oh, like you do.

GEORGE: Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.

JERRY: (Scoffing) Camp.

GEORGE: It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.

(The intercom buzzes, Jerry talks through it)

JERRY: Elaine?

ELAINE: (Through intercom) Yeah.

(Jerry pushes a button on the intercom - letting her in)

JERRY: Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.

GEORGE: Then why don't you try and get him another job?

JERRY: I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.

GEORGE: What? Did you get the busboy's number?

ELAINE: His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?

(Jerry hands the car keys to Elaine)

GEORGE: How did you get all this?

ELAINE: Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?

JERRY: No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.

GEORGE: (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.

JERRY: You, you're going now?

GEORGE: Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.

JERRY: Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?

ELAINE: I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.

JERRY: I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?

GEORGE: It'll take to long.

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: Take the K-man. A little support..

GEORGE: (Unsure) I don't a..

KRAMER: Take me where? Where?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: An apartment building hallway]

(George's nervous - standing with Kramer infront of the busboy's apartment)

GEORGE: Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.

KRAMER: What am I gonna say?

GEORGE: I don't know.

KRAMER: Well, I'm not an idiot.

GEORGE: Certainly not.

KRAMER: Then we're cool.

GEORGE: Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.

KRAMER: (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.

GEORGE: This is a guy I know.. Kramer.

(Antonio, the busboy, is watching them suspiciously)

KRAMER: ¿Habla espanol?

GEORGE: (To himself) Oh my God.

ANTONIO: Si.

KRAMER: ¿Como se dice.. waterbed?

GEORGE: (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.

KRAMER: You got anything to drink? ¿Agua?

GEORGE: Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.

KRAMER: Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)

GEORGE: Hurry up.

ANTONIO: (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)

KRAMER: His cat's gone.

ANTONIO: (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Antonio's apartment]

(All three sit in silence)

KRAMER: ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in

their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you gotta worry about.

GEORGE: (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.

KRAMER: The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.

GEORGE: (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)

KRAMER: You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.

KRAMER: It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.

JERRY: (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.

KRAMER: Oh? How do you figure?

JERRY: (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.

KRAMER: Why was I in charge of closing the door?

JERRY: (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!

KRAMER: So!

JERRY: (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!

KRAMER: Let me talk to him.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)

ELAINE: Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?

(Jerry pitches her the keys as she goes some tward his bathroom)

JERRY: No hello?

ELAINE: Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?

JERRY: Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.

ELAINE: Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.

JERRY: (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?

ELAINE: I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?

JERRY: There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?

ELAINE: Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!

JERRY: So, you two been, uh..

ELAIEN: No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..

JERRY: What's your airport route?

ELAINE: I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.

JERRY: ..What about the Van Wyck?

ELAINE: I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

JERRY: Oooh.

ELAINE: Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?

JERRY: You still using that old alarm clock?

ELAIEN: Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Elaine's apartment]

(Elaine and Ed are in bed. Elaine awakes to find out that it's 9:15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)

ELAINE: (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!

ED: 9:15?

ELAINE: Yes! 9:15!

ED: (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.

ELAINE: Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!

ED: Can I shower?

ELAINE: Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!

ED: I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

ELAINE: Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?

ED: The kitchen.

ELAINE: The kitchen?!

ED: I've got a bag of cashews in there.

ELAINE: They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!

ED: What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.

ELAINE: No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!

ED: I'll never make it.

ELAINE: Don't say that!

ED: But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.

ELAINE: Shut up and pack!

ED: And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?

ELAINE: You're talking too much!

ED: Where's my sweater?

ELAINE: What?!

ED: My brown sweater.

ELAINE: What? What sweater?

ED: My brown sweater.

ELAINE: You didn't bring a brown sweater.

ED: I brought a brown sweater.

ELAINE: Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!

ED: That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.

ELAINE: It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)

ED: What are you doing?!

ELAINE: NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)

ED: My shoes. You packed my shoes.

ELAINE: Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Anywhere in the city?

GEORGE: Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.

JERRY: Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?

GEORGE: Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.

JERRY: Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.

GEORGE: (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.

(Elaine enters. She's still wearing her nightclothes under her coat. Her hair is messed up. She's been through quite an ordeal)

ELAINE: (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!

GEORGE: The busboy's coming?

JERRY: You don't mean here?

KRAMER: Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..

GEORGE: He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.

JERRY: Where are you going?

GEORGE: I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.

JERRY: (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.

KRAMER: No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.

GEORGE: Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..

(There's a knock in the hallway)

KRAMER: Antonio. In here!

(Antonio enters)

GEORGE: (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?

(Antonio crosses over to George, and gives him a hug)

ANTONIO: Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)

GEORGE: (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..

(The intercom buzzes)

ELAINE: (Into the intercom) Yeah?

ED: It's Eddie.

ELAINE: He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..

ANTONIO: And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)

(Everyone ad-libs congratulations to George. Then, we hear a fight erupting from the hallway)

ED: Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!

ANTONIO: Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!

ED: Who do you think you're talking to, pal?

ANTONIO: Hey, get your hands off me!

ED: Go to hell!

(Antonio screams out profanity in Spanish, then we hear them getting into a serious fight)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Coffee shop]

JERRY: He'll get another job. He's a busboy!

GEORGE: It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.

JERRY: It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.

GEORGE: That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.

ELAINE: Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.

GEORGE: So, much longer?

ELAINE: Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?

GEORGE: (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.

ELAINE: Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)

GEORGE: I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.

JERRY: Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.

JERRY: Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."



[Daytime - Exterior of a building then inside to a Massage Room]

(Jerry is getting a massage.)

JULIANNA: ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

JERRY: What do you think the worst part of being blind is?

JULIANNA: Excuse me?

JERRY: You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?

JULIANNA: I don't know.

JERRY: I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.

JULIANNA: Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.

JERRY: You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?

JULIANNA: No.

JERRY: He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.

JULIANNA: Oh.

JERRY: Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.

JULIANNA (visibly uncomfortable): Have you seen any good movies?

JERRY: Who takes care of your boy during the day?

JULIANNA: We have a woman. Why?

JERRY: No no. I'm just saying.

JULIANNA: She had references.

JERRY: Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.

(Julianna pauses to think about what Jerry is saying)

JERRY: (about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.

JULIANNA: I don't live near here, ya know!

(Jerry raises his head up and looks confused.)



[Jerry, Elaine and George are in Jerry's apartment. George is looking through the fridge.]

JERRY: So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.

ELAINE: I don't like to talk during a massage.

JERRY: Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.

GEORGE: Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.

ELAINE: Oh! I forgot to tell you--

JERRY: I'm in the middle of a story.

ELAINE: Oh, okay, go ahead.

GEORGE: Why don't you ever go shopping?

JERRY: Well it’s not like it's a really funny story or anything.

ELAINE: What happened?

JERRY: Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

ELAINE: Oh, wasn't that terrible?

JERRY: Yes, it was.

GEORGE: Not even an apple.

ELAINE: She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.

JERRY: I know it was stupid.

ELAINE: Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)

JERRY: Hey, I just said it was stupid.

GEORGE: What about this leftover Chinese food?

JERRY: Take it.

ELAINE: I can't believe you said that.

JERRY: Hey, would you stop it already?

ELAINE: So, what’d she say?

JERRY: I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.

GEORGE: (he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)

ELAINE: I have a good masseuse you could go to.

JERRY: Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.

(George closes the fridge door and pauses for a second contemplating what he just heard.)

GEORGE: Physical therapy is covered by insurance?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: You don't have to pay for the massage?

JERRY: Not if you have a doctor's note.

ELAINE: So where do you get this note?

JERRY: Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.

GEORGE: Right, your friend Roy.

ELAINE: What's the name of this physical therapist?

JERRY: I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.

GEORGE: And you don't have to pay.

(George and Elaine give each other a “sounds good” look)



[George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office.]

GEORGE: We have a, three-o'clock appointments.

RECEPTIONIST: George and Elaine, right?

ELAINE: Right.

RECEPTIONIST: Could you fill these out for me please? And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna…

ELAINE: (quietly) Ok.

RECEPTIONIST: … And George, you'll be with Raymond.

(George was just about seated when he hears the news, pauses for a second, then stands.)

GEORGE: Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?

RECEPTIONIST: Yes.

GEORGE: But, uh, Raymond is a man.

RECEPTIONIST: That's right.

(George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.)

GEORGE: I can't get a massage from a man.

ELAINE: Why not?

GEORGE: What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.

ELAINE: No, I don't want the man either.

GEORGE: What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.

ELAINE: He'd just be touching your back.

GEORGE: He'd just be touching your back too.

ELAINE: No, it could get sexual.

GEORGE: I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.

ELAINE: I wouldn't be comfortable.

GEORGE: I would? What if something happens?

ELAINE: What could happen?

GEORGE: What if it felt good?

ELAINE: It's supposed to feel good.

GEORGE: I don't want it to feel good.

ELAINE: Then why get the massage?

GEORGE: Exactly!

(They go back to filing out the forms. A man walks up dressed in white.)

RAYMOND: George?

(George looks up, in stages, each time a little higher until he is looking up at Raymond’s face and pauses)

GEORGE: Yes?

RAYMOND: I'm Raymond. (with a big smile)

GEORGE: Hello.(with not a big smile)

RAYMOND: Are you ready? (smiling, he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome Raymond.)

(George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond. Raymond puts his hand on George’s back for a second then removes it. George looks back at Elaine -- she continues to have a huge smile on as she watches them walk down the hallway)



[A shirtless George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George appears extremely uncomfortable.]

RAYMOND: …And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.

GEORGE: Really.

RAYMOND: Use to be a flight attendant.

GEORGE: Oh boy.

RAYMOND: Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.

(George looks back up at Raymond, who is massaging his left hand with his right hand while waiting for George. George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down to his hips. George appears completely startled. Raymond then starts massaging his lower back.)

RAYMOND: So what do you do?

GEORGE: What?

RAYMOND: I said, 'What do you do?'.

GEORGE: I-I don't know.

RAYMOND: You don't know what you do?

GEORGE: Nah.

RAYMOND: Ohh-ho, come on. Hey, you're very tense.

GEORGE: hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).

RAYMOND: Okay, just take off those pants now, and I'll work the hamstring.

GEORGE: Oh, the hamstring’s fine.

RAYMOND: But you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board)

GEORGE: I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.

RAYMOND: I'll check it out. (makes a notation on the form)

GEORGE: Are you sure?

RAYMOND: Yeah, take 'em off. (continues writing)

(George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond rubbing his hands with oil. Raymond has a big smile on his face. Nervous, George takes his pants off, pauses for a second while holding the crumpled pants, he tosses them to the floor. Now dressed in just his boxer shorts and socks he quickly climbs back on the table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid with discomfort.)

RAYMOND: How did you hurt this?

GEORGE: I don't know.

RAYMOND: You don't know?

GEORGE: No.

RAYMOND: But you just told me--

GEORGE: Korea.

RAYMOND: You hurt it in Korea?

GEORGE: What?

RAYMOND: The hamstring.

GEORGE: Korea.

RAYMOND: How?

GEORGE: Hamstring.

RAYMOND: How did you hurt the hamstring?

GEORGE: Hotel.



[Elaine is in the waiting room -- moving her head and neck around she breathes in through her teeth, a sigh of relief. George walks out very slowly, he appears positively shell-shocked.]

ELAINE: How'd it go? George?

(George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.)



[Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.]

JERRY: No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.

(George enters acting nervous.)

JERRY: What's with you?

GEORGE: A... ah...

JERRY: Yes, A...?

GEORGE: A man gave me...

JERRY: Yes, a man gave you...?

GEORGE: A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu…

JERRY: So?

GEORGE: So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh…

JERRY: He was what?!

GEORGE: He-he was uh… touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)

JERRY: That's a massage.

GEORGE: And then I took my pants off.

JERRY: You took your pants off?

GEORGE: For my hamstring.

JERRY: Oh.

GEORGE: He got about uh, two inches from... there.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: I think it moved.

JERRY: Moved?

GEORGE: It may have moved, I don't know.

JERRY: I'm sure it didn't move.

GEORGE: It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.

JERRY: Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.

GEORGE: No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.

JERRY: Okay, so what if it moved?

GEORGE: That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.

JERRY: That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.

GEORGE: You think it's contact? It has to be touched?

JERRY: That's what a gym teacher once told me.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.

JERRY: Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?

KRAMER: Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.

JERRY: No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.

KRAMER: Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.

GEORGE: I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.

JERRY: I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.

KRAMER: Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?

JERRY: He can have a donut,

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: …but not at Dinky.

GEORGE: I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.

KRAMER: Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.

GEORGE: The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.

JERRY: I never said I'd do that.

GEORGE: What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.

JERRY: I don't know how I feel about it.

GEORGE: Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?

JERRY: Alright, alright.

KRAMER: A stall man, huh? (small laugh)

GEORGE: All right -- (Gets up to leave)

KRAMER: Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)



[George and Jerry are in Roy's office.]

JERRY: ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.

GEORGE: He didn't say he can't.

JERRY: I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.

GEORGE: He doesn't feel funny.

JERRY: If he does.

GEORGE: Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.

JERRY: He feels funny. You don't have to do this.

GEORGE: He knows that!

JERRY: Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?

GEORGE: Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

ROY: Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?

GEORGE: How would I know?

ROY: Do you like him?

GEORGE: What do you mean, like him?

ROY: Do you like him?

GEORGE: I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.

ROY: How come you don't like him?

GEORGE: Why should I?

JERRY: What is the matter with you?

GEORGE: Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?

ROY: So, you want the notes?

JERRY: You don't have to, really.

ROY: Nah nah, it's ok.

JERRY: We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?



[Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.]

JERRY: Well what about the week after?

(Jerry sits on the couch, but Elaine is a little too close to the end and he has to squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down)

JERRY: No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)

ELAINE: What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)

(She tries to move, but Jerry is sitting on the edge of her dress. She has to tug on it, then move over.)

JERRY: Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.

ELAINE: Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.

JERRY: Uh huh.

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Joe DiMaggio?

KRAMER: Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.

ELAINE: Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!

KRAMER: That's right.

JERRY: See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

KRAMER: Oh, he's a dunker.

ELAINE: Why couldn't he be a dunker?

KRAMER: And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that he’ll look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.

ELAINE: So then what?

KRAMER: Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.

ELAINE: Why didn't you just call out his name?

(George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee.)

JERRY: What happened to you?

GEORGE: These kids called me a Mary.

ELAINE: A what?

GEORGE: I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.

KRAMER: Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.

ELAINE: Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?

(George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers it, Jerry grabs it from him.)

JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.

KRAMER (singing): ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...

JERRY: I told you.

GEORGE: Told me what?

JERRY: I told you we shouldn't do it.

GEORGE: He didn't say anything.

JERRY: He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.

ELAINE: Three notes?

JERRY: Yeah, you, me and George.

ELAINE: You got me a note?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: But I got my own note.

JERRY: You what?

ELAINE: I got a note from my gynecologist.

JERRY: Why'd you do that?

ELAINE: I didn't know you were getting me a note.

JERRY: Of course I was getting you a note.

ELAINE: But you didn't say anything. Ohhh…

JERRY: Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.

GEORGE: No Doctor--

ELAINE: Wait a--

KRAMER: How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.

(Kramer leaves.)



[Jerry and George are at Roy's office.]

JERRY: Hi Pam.

PAM: Hello.

GEORGE: Hello.

JERRY: I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um…

(Roy walks in.)

ROY: Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.

JERRY: Hi Roy.

GEORGE: How ya doing?

ROY: Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.



[Roy, Jerry and George are talking over a woman sleeping in a dental chair.]

JERRY: I don't even know what to say.

GEORGE: Me neither.

JERRY: I knew this would happen.

GEORGE: Me too.

JERRY: I mean the whole thing, it's just...

GEORGE: Tragic.

JERRY: Well it's not tragic.

GEORGE: No?

JERRY: No, it's...

GEORGE: Unsettling?

JERRY: Okay. I mean, what if the--

(Pam walks in and interrupts.)

PAM: I hope you're both happy. (she turns and walks away)

(Roy looks at Jerry and with his mouth closed -- smiles with his right cheek and frowns with his left cheek.)

JERRY: I'm not happy.

GEORGE: Me neither. I've never been happy.

JERRY: I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.

GEORGE: In college, maybe. Those were fun times.

JERRY: Yeah, college was fun.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah.

(Pam walks in again and interjects.)

PAM: You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that? (she turns and walks away again.)

ROY: Don't mind her.

JERRY: Oh please, I love her.

GEORGE: I've just met her but I'm very impressed.

ROY: I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.

JERRY: Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?

ROY: Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.

JERRY: What? The physical therapist? Why?

ROY: She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.

(The woman in the chair wakes up and looks at Jerry and George.)

GEORGE: How ya doing?



[Jerry and George are at Julianna's office.]

JERRY: Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.

RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not in.

JERRY: Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.

RECEPTIONIST: I told you, she's not here.

JERRY: You don't understand, ah…

RECEPTIONIST: Look, you have to leave.

JERRY: Wait a second, don't you--

(Julianna walks out with her child. When she sees Jerry, she pulls her son in front of her with her arms down on his chest to protect him from Jerry.)

JERRY: Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --

JULIANNA: Please!

JERRY: --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--

JULIANNA: I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!

JERRY: Can't you just listen to me?

JULIANNA (releasing her child): Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! (to the receptionist) Call the police!

(Julianna then runs down the hall.)

JERRY: The police?

(Raymond the masseuse walks up.)

RAYMOND: What is the --. Hi George. (stands there with a big smile)

GEORGE: Hello.

JERRY (to George): Raymond?

(George appears to be very uncomfortable.)



[Jerry, Elaine and George are at the coffee shop.]

ELAINE: Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.

JERRY: Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.

GEORGE: Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.

ELAINE: Of what?

(to Elaine, George makes a “you know” face and rolls his right hand open -- she responds with an equally silent yet somewhat disgusted face that says “Oh.”)

GEORGE: And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"

ELAINE: What do they do?

GEORGE: They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"

(Jerry spots Kramer through the window. He’s talking to a guy in a blue coat.)

JERRY: Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.

(Kramer enters and sits at the booth.)

KRAMER: Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh.… I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.

(All three put down their coffee cups simultaneously.)

JERRY: Did he say anything?

KRAMER: No no, he's fine.

JERRY (noticing something across the coffee shop): Oh my god, it's...

GEORGE (looking over): Joe DiMaggio.

ELAINE: (gasps)

KRAMER: Where?

JERRY: Having a cup of coffee.

(shot of a man in a suit jacket and tie, dunking a donut in a cup of coffee)

ELAINE: And he's dunking!

KRAMER: Yeah -- yeah.

JERRY: Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper…

KRAMER: (quietly) yeah.

JERRY: …here.

GEORGE: You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.

KRAMER: Wait, wait… hold on now, wait, wait… *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.



[Closing monologue.]

JERRY: What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"

JERRY: Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...



[Monks]

PATRICE: Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats

GEORGE:I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?

PATRICE: uh uh

GEORGE: What if it rains?

PATRICE: They're art. You hang them on the wall.

GEORGE:Oh, art!

PATRICE: It's my creative outlet. One of my passions.

GEORGE: Any money in it?

PATRICE: Who so belongs only to his age, references only popenjays and mumbo jumbos

GEORGE: Of course, right.

PATRICE: Thomas Carlisle, 1864.

GEORGE: Tommy C.



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.

KRAMER: I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited

JERRY: I don't blame you. I blame myself.

KRAMER: No, blame me.

JERRY: OK, I blame you.

KRAMER: Don't blame me.

JERRY: What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.

KRAMER: It was supposed to erupt.

JERRY: I find the whole thing very embarrassing.

KRAMER: You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.

JERRY: Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Hi,

JERRY: Hi

ELAINE: Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.

(Jerry smiles)

ELAINE: What's so funny

JERRY: Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.

ELAINE: Uh, it's a riot Alice.

KRAMER: When do you pit the sauce on?

ELAINE: Any other time.

KRAMER: I like to strain the sauce.

ELAINE: And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room

KRAMER: Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

ELAINE: What are you doing? What is all this?

JERRY: Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.

ELAINE: O, your being auditted? What for?

JERRY: Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.

ELAINE: When was this?

JERRY: Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.

ELAINE: I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.

JERRY: Volcano? Really?

ELAINE: Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...

JERRY: Something to drink?

ELAINE: What did you think, that would impress me?

JERRY: You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans

ELAINE: Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?

JERRY: Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.

ELAINE: Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.

JERRY: No, that's Krama.

ELAINE: So, waddya' going to do?

JERRY: It's all taken care of.

ELAINE: How is that?

KRAMER: (chuckles)

JERRY: An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.

ELAINE: Why is she doing this?

JERRY: I don't know. It must be love.



[Monks]

GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.

PATRICE: What did I do?

GEORGE: Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.

PATRICE: You hate my earrings don't you?

GEORGE: No, no,

PATRICE: And you didn't comment on the chop sticks.

GEORGE: I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.

PATRICE: You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something.

GEORGE: I have a fear of intimacy

PATRICE: Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?

GEORGE: Nothing. It's not YOU..

PATRICE: I want the truth.

GEORGE: The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?

PATRICE: Keep goin'.

GEORGE: I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.

PATRICE: No, I asked for the truth. Thank you for being so honest.

GEORGE: Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?

PATRICE: I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe?

GEORGE: Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: ... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands

ELAINE: I don't blame ya'

JERRY: Have you ever been through an audit?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah

GEORGE: George

JERRY: Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor

GEORGE: My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)

JERRY: And there's so much more to go.

GEORGE: Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth

JERRY: So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?

GEORGE: Oh, oh, your papers

JERRY: What happened you didn't give her the papers?

GEORGE: No. I did.

JERRY: SO?

GEORGE: ...I broke up with her.

(Kramer leaves)

JERRY: You what?

GEORGE: I broke up with her.

JERRY: I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?

GEORGE: It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.

JERRY: Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.

GEORGE: Oh, no. We left on good terms.

JERRY: How is that possible?

GEORGE: Because I uh, I told her the truth.

JERRY: Oh, my God.

GEORGE: It's OK.

JERRY: It's unheard of ...

GEORGE: She asked me to.

JERRY: So you lie! What did you tell her?

GEORGE: I told her that she was pretentious.

JERRY: Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want

ELAINE: How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?

GEORGE: Like what? What could they say?

ELAINE: There are plenty of things to say.

GEORGE: Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?

ELAINE: George, please.

GEORGE: Give me one.

ELAINE: You sure?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: What?

ELAINE: Forget it. You are very careful with money.

GEORGE: I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?

ELAINE: You asked me to.

GEORGE: You should have lied.

ELAINE: HUH, so should you.

JERRY: OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?

GEORGE:(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.

ELAINE: I know.

GEORGE: When I was working I spent baby.

JERRY: Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?

GEORGE: She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.

ELAINE: Pocketbook or a handbag?

JERRY: Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.

GEORGE: Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)

JERRY: What? What?

GEORGE: She never came back from lunch.

JERRY: This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.

GEORGE: (dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.

JERRY: Not good.

GEORGE: All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)

JERRY: Not good



[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a windshield.

JERRY: I can see that. What's it for?

KRAMER: I found it on the road.

JERRY: Yeah (to buzzer)

ELAINE: (from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.

JERRY: wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?

KRAMER: wow

(Elaine enters - she and Kramer avoid each other's stares)

ELAINE: hell-oo

KRAMER: hell-oo

JERRY: What's with you two?

ELAINE: You haven't told him?

JERRY: Tell me what?

ELAINE: Huh, go ahead, tell him.

KRAMER: I, I saw her naked.

ELAINE: He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.

KRAMER: Well, you know, ... it was an accident.

ELAINE: Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!

KRAMER: I thought it was a closet.

JERRY: Completely naked?

KRAMER: Completely naked.

ELAINE: Jerrryyy, How can I go on?

KRAMER: All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.

(Kramer begins disrobing)

ELAINE: No thanks!

KRAMER: No, I want you to see me naked.

ELAINE: No, no no.

KRAMER: No, I want to show you.

ELAINE: No! Jerry! Jerry!

JERRY: OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.

(Kramer sits down picks up windshield)

ELAINE: What is this?

KRAMER: Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.

ELAINE: Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.

JERRY: You'll sense it.

(George enters slowly)

JERRY: Well, what happened? Was she there?

GEORGE: No, no she wasn't.

JERRY: You didn't get my papers?

GEORGE: No, I didn't.

JERRY: Well, where is she?

GEORGE: A mental institution.



[Middle Monologue]

JERRY: Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: A mental institution?

KRAMER: You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.

GEORGE: It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.

ELAINE: Who told you this:

GEORGE: Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.

KRAMER: My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.

JERRY: You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!

GEORGE: She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.

JERRY: So what now?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Can we go out there?

GEORGE: Where?

JERRY: Woodhaven.

GEORGE: We could.



[Woodhaven]

GEORGE: I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.

JERRY: My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"

GEORGE: I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.

JERRY: That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.

GEORGE: Potato

JERRY: Tuberculosis

GEORGE: Blanket

JERRY: Leroy

GEORGE: Grass

JERRY: Tuberculosis

GEORGE: Oh, boy. Here she comes.



[Elaine's Apartment]

(African music is playing as Elaine enters, dirty pots and dishes are piled high in the kitchen)

ELAINE: Oh, my god.

(Kramer enters dancing with only a towel on.)

ELAINE: KRAMER!

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.

KRAMER: Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.

TINA: Kramer, are you coming back to bed?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.

TINA: Oh, hi Elaine. (returns Elaine's ear rings) What did you think of the coffee table?

ELAINE: It's invisible.

KRAMER: So, is everything cool? or what?

TINA: Yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional.

ELAINE: Well,

TINA: Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.

ELAINE: The Truth!, You want The Truth?



[Woodhaven]

PATRICE: Who are you?

GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend Jerry.

PATRICE: Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?

JERRY: Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.

PATRICE: George thinks I'm pretentious.

GEORGE: Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.

PATRICE: You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.

GEORGE: No, that's not it at all.

PATRICE: Don't LIE George.

GEORGE :I'M NOT A LIER!

GEORGE: Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)

JERRY: Just chatting. Friendly.

GEORGE: All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.

PATRICE: I know what you said. You can't change that.

GEORGE: What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.

JERRY: It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?

GEORGE: You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.

PATRICE: You mean that?

GEORGE: Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.

JERRY: He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.

PATRICE: Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.

JERRY: there are no copies.

PATRICE: So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?

JERRY: Who makes copies?



[Elaine's Apartment]

ELAINE: The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.

(Elaine exits)

KRAMER: Oh,

TINA: Kramer,

(dancing in the dark to the music)

TINA: Here Kramer?

KRAMER: No, lets go to the couch...

(sound of smashing glass)



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: (on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.

JERRY: Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.

ELAINE: I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.

(Kramer enter - all bandaged up.)

KRAMER: Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?

ELAINE: Yeah, I suppose I am.

KRAMER: All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.

JERRY: You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.

GEORGE: Hey, I'm getting in on that.

ELAINE: You know you're chippin' in.

GEORGE: You're going that way anyway!



[Closing Monologue]

JERRY: I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"

JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."



[Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents]

HELEN: (looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again.

MORTY: (searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.

HELEN: Oh I think that's them!

MORTY: You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

(Jerry and Elaine enter)

ALL: Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc.

MORTY: Welcome to Florida!

ELAINE: Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)

JERRY: Hey, there's the old man! (hug)

MORTY: So, what took you so long?

JERRY: Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.

HELEN: I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.

JERRY: What's the difference?

HELEN: You could have used our car.

JERRY: I don't wanna use your car.

HELEN: What's wrong with our car?

JERRY: Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?

HELEN: We don't use it.

MORTY: What are you talking? We use it.

HELEN: If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.

JERRY: So what would you do? You'd hitch?

HELEN: How much is a rent-a-car?

JERRY: I don't know. 25 bucks a day.

HELEN: What? You're crazy.

MORTY: Plus the insurance.

JERRY: Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

MORTY: How could you not get the insurance?

HELEN: We'll pay for the car.

JERRY: You're not paying for it.

HELEN: Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)

JERRY: God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?

HELEN: You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?

JERRY: It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?

HELEN: Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.

JERRY: (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.

ELAINE: (looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?

JERRY: The lake isn't real.

HELEN: The lake is real.

MORTY: Are you kidding? They built the lake.

HELEN: But it's real. It's water.

(Jerry and Elaine take their luggages to the guest room)

HELEN: Where are you going with those?

JERRY: I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.

HELEN: Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.

ELAINE: I can't take your bedroom.

HELEN: I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

ELAINE: I can't kick you out of your bed.

HELEN: We don't even sleep.

JERRY: Ma.

HELEN: But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.

JERRY: (to Morty) What about you?

MORTY: Why should I be comfortable?

JERRY: (to Helen) What about him?

HELEN: Don't worry, he's comfortable.

MORTY: I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.

HELEN: Will you stop?

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)

HELEN: Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.

JERRY: Na, that's not such a good idea.

HELEN: Well I tought that...

JERRY: Not now. She's right inside.

HELEN: (quieter) What happened?

JERRY: I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.

HELEN: What does that mean?

JERRY: Well...

MORTY: (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?

JERRY: Shh! Nothing, nothing.

HELEN: Elaine...

MORTY: (still loud) What about her?

JERRY: (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.

MORTY: (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.

HELEN: He's an idealist.

MORTY: What the hell are you looking for?

JERRY: I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.

HELEN: He likes looking.

MORTY: So look.

HELEN: But how long can you look?

JERRY: I'm going for the record.

(Morty walks away with a face like he disagrees with Jerry)

HELEN: You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.

JERRY: Oh, come on.

HELEN: This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.

(knock on door: this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)

MORTY: Aha!

DORIS: So they arrived safely.

MORTY: (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?

JERRY: Nice to see you. This is Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi. Nice to meet you.

JACK: So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?

ELAINE: And scuba diving.

HELEN: Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?

JERRY: We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.

HELEN: What do you have to go scuba diving for?

JERRY: For fun.

HELEN: For fun?

MORTY: Jack have some spong cake.

JACK: No. thanks, no.

MORTY: Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.

JACK: So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?

JERRY: I don't think so.

JACK: No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).

MORTY: What did you have? You had the minute steak?

JACK: Yeah.

MORTY: Did you have a coke or what?

JACK: I did NOT have a coke.

MORTY: Somebody had a coke.

HELEN: Oh I had a coke.

DORIS: And I had the scampi.

JACK: So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.

MORTY: All right. Make it 20 bucks.

JACK: It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)

MORTY: 19.45$ ?

JACK: See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.

(Jerry notices Klompus's pen)

JERRY: What kind of pen is that?

JACK: This pen?

JERRY: Yeah.

JACK: This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.

JERRY: Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?

JACK: Oh it was a gift.

JERRY: Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.

JACK: Take the pen.

JERRY: Oh no.

JACK: Go ahead.

JERRY: I couldn't

JACK: Come on, take the pen!

JERRY: I can't take it.

JACK: Do me a personal favor!

JERRY: No, I'm not...

JACK: Take the pen!

JERRY: I cannot take it!

JACK: Take the pen!

JERRY: Are you sure?

JACK: Positive! Take the pen!

JERRY: O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!

HELEN: Jack, what are you doing?

JACK: Stop it!

DORIS: Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice meeting you.

ELAINE: Mmm, nice to meet you.

JERRY: Thanks again.

JACK: Come on!

DORIS: (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)

HELEN: (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?

JERRY: What he gave it to me.

HELEN: You didn't have to take it.

MORTY: Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.

JERRY: He offered it to me.

HELEN: Because you made such a big fuss about it.

JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?

HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)

JERRY: He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.

HELEN: He loves that pen.

MORTY: Oh come on!

HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.

JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.

HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet.

JERRY: Well, he was wrong.

HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)

JERRY: So you want me to return it?

HELEN: Yes.

MORTY: He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.

JERRY: Hey I don't even want the pen now!

MORTY: Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!

ELAINE: Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.

(scene ends)



[setting: condo's guest room]

(Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall asleep)

(knock on door)

ELAINE: Come in.

JERRY: Are you O.K. in here?

ELAINE: Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?

JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.

ELAINE: Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.

JERRY: Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.

ELAINE: I am never gonna fall asleep.

JERRY: Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.

ELAINE: How can they not put the air conditioning on?

JERRY: They're nuts with temperature.

ELAINE: This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.

JERRY: How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?

ELAINE: I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.

JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)

(scene ends)



[setting: condo, morning]

(Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)

MORTY: Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?

JERRY: Stay on Biscayne.

HELEN: You're going underwater?

JERRY: Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.

HELEN: What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?

JERRY: What's so special up here?

(Elaine open the guest room's door and she's in pain)

ELAINE: Oh!

(everybody get up and walk to her)

HELEN: What's the matter?

ELAINE: My back.

HELEN: What happened?

ELAINE: That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.

HELEN: (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.

JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.

ELAINE: I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.

JERRY: You can't go?

HELEN: So stay home.

ELAINE: You can go.

JERRY: Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.

HELEN: Don't go.

JERRY: You sure?

MORTY: Maybe you should see a doctor.

JERRY: We'll stay in a hotel tonight.

ELAINE: (whispering to Jerry) Yes!

HELEN: No, we'll stay in there.

JERRY: Why don't you get a new sofa?

MORTY: Nobody uses it.

JERRY: I'm buying you a new sofa.

HELEN: Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.

ELAINE: Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.

HELEN: You're hot?

ELAINE: I've lost 6 pounds.

HELEN: I don't even know how to work it.

MORTY: I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.

(Evelyn, a neighboor, enters)

EVELYN: Is everybody up?

JERRY: Hi. How are you?

EVELYN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.

ELAINE: (with pain) Hi Evelyn.

EVELYN: Jerry you got thin.

JERRY: Too thin?

HELEN: Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.

EVELYN: So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)

JERRY: (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?

EVELYN: The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.

HELEN: How did you know that?

EVELYN: Blanche told me.

HELEN: Blanche?

EVELYN: That's some good pen. It writes upside down.

ELAINE: The astronauts use them.

HELEN: What did Blanche say?

EVELYN: I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.

JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.

MORTY: He gave him the pen.

HELEN: Morty.

EVELYN: Why you don't like the pen?

JERRY: No, no, I...

EVELYN: Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.

HELEN: Is that what she said?

EVELYN: Who?

HELEN: Blanche.

EVELYN: What are you talking about?

(The phone rings, Helen answers.)

HELEN: Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)

ELAINE: Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!

MORTY: (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.

(the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.)

JERRY: All I said was "I like the pen".

(Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner)

MORTY: How the hell do you work this thing?

(scene ends)



[setting: still the condo, later]

(Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)

HELEN: Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

ELAINE: No no, I wanna go.

HELEN: But your back hurts.

MORTY: Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.

ELAINE: Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.

HELEN: No. I'm fine.

ELAINE: You're not too cold?

HELEN: No.

(Jerry enters with a black eye)

JERRY: Don't be alarmed.

MORTY: Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?

JERRY: I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.

HELEN: Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?

JERRY: (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?

ELAINE: Having a good time!

JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?

HELEN: What happened to your eyes?

JERRY: Well I started to go under...

HELEN: With the instructor?

JERRY: Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.

HELEN: I told you...

(Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar)

JACK: Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?

ELAINE: My back hurts.

JACK: Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.

MORTY: We got plenty of time.

JACK: (to Jerry) What happened to you?

JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.

HELEN: It's from scuba diving.

JACK: What's there to see underwater?

(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like: give him back the pen)

JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.

JACK: You what?

JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)

JACK: Well I mean...

JERRY: Take it.

JACK: All right! (he smiles and take it)

(Morty gets up and walks right to Jack)

MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

JACK: Whose pen?

MORTY: His pen.

JACK: This happens to be my pen.

MORTY: You didn't give it to him.

JACK: What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.

MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?

JACK: Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?

MORTY: You said you didn't want it!

JACK: Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!

MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?

(Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing)

JACK: Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!

MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!

JACK: Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!

MORTY: I don't want it!

JACK: I don't want it!

MORTY: You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!

JACK: Listen do you think I give a damn?

MORTY: Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.

JERRY: What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?

HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)

JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?

MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.

JERRY: Well. This should be a very interesting evening.

ELAINE: (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?

(scene ends)



[setting: reception room, evening]

(Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.)

PHOTOGRAPHER: Say astronaut.

(Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.)

ELAINE: Say what? (laughing) Say what?

JERRY: (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.

MORTY: Astronaut?

HELEN: Say it.

JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN: Astronaut!

ELAINE: (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!

(the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.)

MORTY: Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?

JERRY: Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)

JERRY: (to Leo) Uncle Leo.

LEO: Hello!

STELLA: Morty are you nervous?

MORTY: What nervous?

LEO: (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?

JERRY: I've got a black eye.

STELLA: (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.

JERRY: Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.

HELEN: (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!

JERRY: (to Stella) Her back hurts.

STELLA: Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.

LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.

JERRY: No, no.

LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.

ELAINE: (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!

LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.

MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!

LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.

(Jack and Morty exchange a look.)

STELLA: (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.

HELEN: (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.

(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells: "Hey Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)

JACK: (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.

MORTY: (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)

JACK: Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)

HELEN: (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.

JACK: His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.

MORTY: (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.

JACK: But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)

MORTY: (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)

JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!

JACK: He gave it to me!

MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!

JACK: I'm not sitting down!

(they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight)

JACK: Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)

HELEN: Jerry, do your act.

JERRY: (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.

HELEN: They're all gonna leave.

JERRY: (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)

MAN IN THE CROWD: Who are you?

JERRY: (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?

WOMAN IN THE CROWD: (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.

(Elaine is almost asleep at the table)

JERRY: Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?

MAN IN THE CROWD: I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!

HELEN: (to Jerry) Do the dog routine.

JERRY: All I said was I liked the pen!

ELAINE: (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!

(Everybody stops talking and put their hands on their ears)

[setting: condo, morning]

(Elaine is sitting on the couch and a chiro is examining her. Jerry's sitting next to her. Helen is standing beside them and Morty is still asleep in the guest room)

CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.

ELAINE: Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?

JERRY: There must be some mistake.

CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not.

ELAINE: (discouraged) Five days. Here.

HELEN: (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!

JERRY: (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...

ELAINE: Excuse me?

JERRY: Nothing.

(Evelyn enters)

EVELYN: Good morning.

JERRY: Hi Evelyn.

EVELYN: (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

HELEN: I don't think so.

EVELYN: Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.

HELEN: Well I'll ask him when he gets up.

EVELYN: Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.

(Morty gets up in a bad shape)

MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?

HELEN: I was very comfortable.

EVELYN: Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.

HELEN: It's in the constitution.

MORTY: (to the chiro) Who are you?

CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor.

MORTY: What are you kidding me?

ELAINE: (to Jerry) Five more days?

JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)

(scene ends)

[setting: night club, closing monologue]

JERRY: Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."

JERRY: So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!



[New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated) man.]

GAVIN: Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.

JERRY: Is he on the plane now?

GAVIN: Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?

JERRY: Uh, just my next door neighbor.

GAVIN: You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.

JERRY: Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?

(Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.)

JERRY: What's the matter?

GAVIN: Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.



[Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.]

ATTENDANT #1: Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital.

GAVIN: My dog. What about my dog?

ATTENDANT #1: Uh, you have a dog?

ATTENDANT #2: Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?

(Jerry stares out the window.)

GAVIN: Jerry?

JERRY: Huh? How you feeling?

GAVIN: Would you take care of Farfel?

JERRY: Farfel?

ATTENDANT #2: It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York?

JERRY: The dog? The dog??

GAVIN: I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

JERRY: But, you know, what if, you know?

GAVIN: Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.

JERRY: The dog?



[New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.]

JERRY: Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?

ELAINE: Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.

JERRY (to Farfel): STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.

ELAINE: If only.

JERRY: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.

ELAINE: Hey, when you walk him, do ya...

JERRY: Do I what?

ELAINE: Do you pick it up?

JERRY: Yes, I pick it up.

ELAINE: You pick it up?!?

JERRY: Well you have to.

ELAINE: Oh, boy would I love to see that.

JERRY: SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?

ELAINE: Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.

JERRY: No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.

ELAINE: No, milk.

JERRY: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.

ELAINE: What is a bender anyhow?

JERRY: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.

ELAINE: I can't believe he hasn't called.

JERRY: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.

JERRY: Why?

ELAINE: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.

KRAMER: I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.

JERRY: You're breaking up?

KRAMER: Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.

ELAINE: Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.

KRAMER: Woah, you didn't like her?

ELAINE: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.

JERRY: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.

KRAMER: How come you never said anything?

JERRY: Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.

KRAMER: I tell you.

JERRY: You. I'm talking about people.

ELAINE: Are we still going to the movies tonight?

JERRY: No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.

ELAINE: Just me and George?

JERRY: Sure.

ELAINE: But we need you.

JERRY: What do you need me for?

(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)

ELAINE: Because... Yeah?

GEORGE: Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)

(Elaine buzzes George into the building.)

ELAINE: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?

JERRY: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!

ELAINE: Just me and George alone?

(George enters.)

GEORGE: Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!

JERRY: I can't go.

GEORGE: Can't go, Why not?

JERRY: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

GEORGE: I thought Kramer was watching.

JERRY: He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.

GEORGE: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.

JERRY: No, I don't want that smell in the house.

GEORGE: You spritz a little Lysol on it.

JERRY: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.

GEORGE: So we're not going?

JERRY: Nah. You two go.

GEORGE: Oh. You still wanna go?

ELAINE: Do, do you?

GEORGE: If you want.

ELAINE: It,s, it's up to you.

JERRY: Go ahead.

ELAINE: Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?

GEORGE: Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?

JERRY: I want to but I can't.

ELAINE: Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: What about this--

JERRY: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.

ELAINE: I know, it's not that.

GEORGE: It's just we want you to go.

JERRY: Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!



[Comedy Club]

JERRY: On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?



[New scene. George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De Leon. They're obviously uncomfortable alone together.]

GEORGE: So how long did you live there?

ELAINE: About three years.

GEORGE: That's pretty long.

ELAINE: Hmm.

GEORGE: It's not that long, really.

ELAINE: Yeah.

(An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same time, then stop. Another silence.)

GEORGE: And then you came here.

ELAINE: Yeah. So I've been here about six years.

GEORGE (Counting on his fingers): Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.



[New scene. Jerry vs. Farfel, part II]

JERRY: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!



[New scene. Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend.]

KRAMER: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.



[New scene. Monk's, Elaine and George are as bored as before.]

GEORGE: I like herbal tea.

(Elaine yawns.)

GEORGE: Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.

ELAINE: Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

GEORGE: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

ELAINE: Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

GEORGE: You don't tell him?

ELAINE (laughing): No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"

GEORGE (laughing): You don't tell him?

ELAINE: No.

GEORGE: That is so funny!

ELAINE: I know!

GEORGE: Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!

(They both make the same convulsive gestures together and break out in more laughter.)



[New scene. Kramer has had a change of heart.]

KRAMER: Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!



[New scene. Jerry's at his apartment, on the phone, Farfel is barking.]

JERRY: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!



[New scene. Jerry and Elaine are cleaning Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.

JERRY: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.

ELAINE: The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.

JERRY (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay, see you in five minutes.

(Jerry hangs up the phone and begins singing and dancing.)

JERRY: Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?

ELAINE: Do you have to?

JERRY: What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.

ELAINE: You know, the guy might have just lost your number.

JERRY: I'm in the book and I have a machine.

ELAINE: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.

JERRY: Really? How late are they open?

(Kramer enters.)

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What is it?

KRAMER: I went back with Ellen.

JERRY and ELAINE: Ohhhhh, that's great.

ELAINE: Terrific.

JERRY: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.

ELAINE: Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.

KRAMER: Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?

JERRY: Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.

KRAMER: From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.

ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: I'm getting my pot.

(Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.)

ELAINE: Kramer, we like her.

JERRY: Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?

ELAINE: I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.

JERRY: I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,

JERRY: Well.

ELAINE: Well.

JERRY: everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?

GEORGE: Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)

(Farfel begins barking.)

JERRY: Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.

ELAINE: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.

JERRY: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.

ELAINE: Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.

JERRY: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?

ELAINE: We'll see it Sunday.

(George enters.)

GEORGE: Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?

ELAINE: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.

GEORGE: What does this mean?

JERRY: Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.

GEORGE: What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.

JERRY: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?

JERRY: I don't know, regular human time?

GEORGE: Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?

JERRY: Why shouldn't I go here?

ELAINE: Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: And isn't it more fun using the urinal?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!

GEORGE: Hey, go.

ELAINE: Who's stopping you?

GEORGE: What, are you doing me a favor?

ELAINE: Like we care if you go to the bathroom.

(Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.)

GEORGE: How's it going?

ELAINE: Good. Good. You?

GEORGE: Things are good.

(After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.)

ELAINE: Boy, he takes such a long time.

GEORGE: I know.

ELAINE: You know what he does in there? He gargles.

GEORGE: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?

ELAINE: Yeah, he does it like six times a day.

GEORGE: How come we never hear him?

ELAINE: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.

(Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.)

GEORGE: Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!

ELAINE: We talked about that already.

GEORGE: Oh.



[New scene. Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater.]

GEORGE: I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.

JERRY: So what are calling me six times a day?

GEORGE: All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.

JERRY: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.

GEORGE: Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.

JERRY: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?

GEORGE: Nothing except Prognosis Negative.

JERRY: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.



[New scene. Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.]

ELAINE: Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!

(The phone rings, Farfel begins barking.)

ELAINE: Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.



[Cut back to Jerry and George.]

GEORGE: I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.

JERRY: I don't know what to do.

GEORGE: What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.

JERRY: I know, I know.

GEORGE: So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.

JERRY: It is kind of silly.

GEORGE: Of course it is.

JERRY: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.

GEORGE: Exactly.

JERRY: It's not like she's *in* the movie.

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.

GEORGE: And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.

JERRY: How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.

GEORGE: Good.

JERRY: Saving movies.

GEORGE: Ridiculous!

JERRY: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.

GEORGE: Oh, you're dead.



[New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. Farfel is barking as loud as ever.]

GAVIN: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!

JERRY: You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.

GAVIN: Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians.

KRAMER: Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!

GAVIN: He won't hurt you, he's just playing.

KRAMER: Hey you keep that mutt away from me.

GAVIN: Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.

ELLEN: Kramer, are you coming?

JERRY: Oh, hi Ellen.

ELLEN: Get in here.

(Kramer sulks off.)

JERRY: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...

GAVIN: Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.

JERRY: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.

(Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's apartment.)



[New scene. Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: We made plans.

JERRY: Why don't we just rent a movie?

ELAINE: I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.

JERRY: No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...

ELAINE: Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

JERRY: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.

ELAINE: Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.

JERRY: You and George got together?

ELAINE: Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.

(Kramer enters.)

JERRY: Hello.

KRAMER: Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

JERRY: What's up?

KRAMER: Well, ah you were right.

JERRY: About what?

KRAMER: Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.

JERRY and ELAINE, together: Awwwwww.

JERRY: Too bad.

ELAINE: I thought she was the one.

KRAMER: I'll bring back the pot.

ELAINE: Okay, c'mon it's movie time.

KRAMER: Hey, what are you gonna see?

JERRY: Prognosis Negative.

KRAMER: Hey, that's supposed to be great.

JERRY: It's not.

KRAMER: How do you know?

JERRY: I have an instinct for these things.



[Closing monologue; Comedy Club]

JERRY: I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?

JERRY: Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'



[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?

KRAMER: enters

JERRY: Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.

KRAMER: What's the problem?

JERRY: This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.

KRAMER: Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000

JERRY: It doesn't work like that.

KRAMER: If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000

JERRY: It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...

FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)

JERRY: That orange dress is burned in my memory

KRAMER: Oh, memory burn.

JERRY: I wonder what ever happened to her.

KRAMER: How did they ever find you?

JERRY: Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.

(buzzer)

JERRY: It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library

KRAMER: You know I never got a library card.

JERRY: (to speaker) Coming down.

KRAMER: It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,

JERRY: I gotta go to the library. You want to go?

KRAMER: Yeah,



[LIBRARY]

KRAMER: The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
JERRY: Where's George

READER: Shhh.

KRAMER: Tryin' to save a quarter.

JERRY: I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.

TURNING TO LIBRARY COUNTER

JERRY: This woman's completely ignoring me.

KRAMER: Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.

JERRY: Eventually a little shot of penicillin

LIBRARIAN: Yes?

JERRY: Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.

LIBRARIAN: Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.

KRAMER: Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?

LIBRARIAN: It's true.

KRAMER: That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.

LIBRARIAN: Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.

JERRY: Can I speak with this Bookman?

LIBRARIAN: Just a second.

(GEORGE ENTERS, FRANTICALLY, TUGS AT JERRY'S JACKET)

GEORGE: Jerry, Jerry

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I think I saw him. I think it's him.

JERRY: Who?

GEORGE: Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: yeah

GEORGE: I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.

READER: Shhh.

JERRY: (whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?

GEORGE: He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.

JERRY: George got him fired. He squealed on him.

KRAMER: Ooh tattle tale

GEORGE: (yells) I didn't tattle

READER: Shh Shh

KRAMER: What did this guy do? What happened?

GEORGE: There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.

KRAMER: Oh come on, You can tell me.

GEORGE: Some other time.

KRAMER: What tonight?

(LIBRARIAN WALKS BY)

KRAMER: Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.

JERRY: Oh, he sang like a canary.

LIBRARIAN: Mr. Bookman's not here.

JERRY: Not here? Why was I told to come down here?

LIBRARIAN: He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

KRAMER: He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?

JERRY: Well what am I supposed to do now?

LIBRARIAN: I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.

JERRY: All right Thanks. Come on lets go

GEORGE: Let's see if it's Hayman?

KRAMER: Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?



[PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES]

ELAINE: Where's Karen?

SECRETARY: She went to pick up lunch.

ELAINE: Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.

SECRETARY: She must have forgot.

ELAINE: How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?

Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.

Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.

SECRETARY: I don't know anything.

ELAINE: Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."

(LIPPMAN ENTERS)

ELAINE: Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.

LIPPMAN: Elaine,

ELAINE: Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?

LIPPMAN: Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.

ELAINE: Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.



[AT MONKS]

ELAINE: I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.

JERRY: So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!

ELAINE: What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!

GEORGE: I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?

ELAINE: What did he do?

GEORGE: He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.

JERRY: I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...

GEORGE: OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.

JERRY: I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.

GEORGE: Little baked beans

JERRY: Echh

ELAINE: Come on tell me what happened.

GEORGE: Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!



[FLASHBACK TO HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM]

GEORGE: ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...

HEYMAN: Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja

GEORGE: Yes, Mr. Hayman

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.

GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.

HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...

HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

(GEORGE gets a wedgie)

 


[BACK TO MONK'S]

GEORGE: He gave me a wedgie.

JERRY: He got fired the next day.

ELAINE: Why do they call it a wedgie?

GEORGE: Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..

JERRY: They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.

ELAINE: Boys are sick.

JERRY: Well what do girls do ?

ELAINE: We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.

(KRAMER ENTERS)

GEORGE: I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.

KRAMER: Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.



[MIDDLE MONOLOGUE]

JERRY: What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?



[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?

BOOKMAN: You got any coffee?

JERRY: Coffee?

BOOKMAN: Yeah. Coffee.

JERRY: No, I don't drink coffee.

BOOKMAN: Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?

JERRY: No, I don't have--

BOOKMAN: You don't have any instant coffee?

JERRY: Well, I don't normally--

BOOKMAN: Who doesn't have instant coffee?

JERRY: I don't.

BOOKMAN: You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.

JERRY: Really? I'll have to remember that.

BOOKMAN: You took this book out in 1971.

JERRY: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

BOOKMAN: Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.

JERRY: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.

BOOKMAN: You're a comedian, you make people laugh.

JERRY: I try.

BOOKMAN: You think this is all a big joke, don't you?

JERRY: No, I don't.

BOOKMAN: I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?

JERRY: Certainly not.

BOOKMAN: Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!

(Marion sneaks into Kramer's apartment behind Bookman's back as he opens Jerry's door to leave)



[KRAMER'S APARTMENT]

KRAMER: What's wrong?

MARION: It's Bookman the library cop.

KRAMER: So I, I didn't do anything wrong.

MARION: I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.

KRAMER: Why don't ya' leave?

MARION: I can't.

(JERRY'S DOORWAY)

JERRY: No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...

 

[IN MONKS WITH SHERRY]

SHERRY: Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.

JERRY: So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?

SHERRY: I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.

JERRY: Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?

SHERRY: Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?

JERRY: No Black Jack?

SHERRY: Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,

JERRY: Tropic of Cancer.

SHERRY: No, Tropic of Capricorn

JERRY: Tropic of Capricorn?

SHERRY: Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... "As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse ."

JERRY: Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.

We read from TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. I was all set to return TROPIC OF CANCER. And then ...



[FLASHBACK TO LOCKER ROOM]

JERRY: George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it

JERRY: Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.



[BACK TO MONKS]

SHERRY: Where ya' going?

JERRY: It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!



[LIBRARY]

KRAMER: Read another poem.

MARION: Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.

KRAMER: Wow, that is great. You should be published.

KRAMER: You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.

MARIAN: Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO!

KRAMER: HELLO!

MARIAN: HELLO!

KRAMER: HELLO!

MARIAN: HELLO!

BOOKMAN (emerging): Hello!

MARIAN (turning, surprised): Mr. Bookman.

BOOKMAN: I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?

 

[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

(Jerry in bedroom)

ELAINE: Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good

JERRY: Maybe you're getting' a raise.

(buzzer)

ELAINE: Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: It's George

ELAINE: George is on his way up.

JERRY: Wait 'til I tell him about the book.

KRAMER: (reading) sobs

ELAINE: Are you OK? What? What?

KRAMER: It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)

ELAINE: Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT

(Jerry enters).

JERRY: I'm right here.

ELAINE: Remember that Columbus book?

JERRY: Columbus, Euro trash.

(George enters)

GEORGE: Well, it's definetly him.

ELAINE: Him? Him who?

GEORGE: Him who? Hayman him.

ELAINE: Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?

GEORGE: Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus

JERRY: That was double overtime.

GEORGE: So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.

ELAINE: At least it wasn't atomic.

GEORGE: It was.

JERRY: So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER

GEORGE: How should I know?

JERRY: Because I gave it to you.

GEORGE: Me?

JERRY: Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.

GEORGE: The locker room!



[THE LOCKER ROOM]

JERRY: Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.

JERRY: All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.

HEYMAN: Can't Stand Ya'.

GEORGE: Yes Mr. Hayman.

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.

GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.

HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...

HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

(George gets a wedgie and TROPIC OF CANCER falls on floor)

GEORGE: (shouting) No No No!



[LIBRARY]

( Jerry writes out a check for the never-returned TROPIC OF CANCER and hands it to Bookman)

JERRY: Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.

BOOKMAN: Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?

JERRY: What is your problem?

BOOKMAN: What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle.

JERRY: (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?

ELAINE: Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.

JERRY: Oh, beautiful did he like them?

ELAINE: No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!

JERRY: (to George) Was he out there?

GEORGE: Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.

JERRY: I guess we'll never know.



[SOME BACK ALLEY]

HEYMAN: Can't stand ya, (laughing) Can't stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground)



[CLOSING MONOLOGUE]

JERRY: Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.

[ACT ONE SCENE A INT. ESCALATOR - GOING DOWN TO A GARAGE. IN SINGLE FILE: GEORGE, JERRY AND ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.]

GEORGE: One left...what a joke.

KRAMER: You can have this one.

GEORGE: No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.

ELAINE: Hey, I didn't get one either.

JERRY: Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?

ELAINE: This is what people do.

JERRY: No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.

(THEY GET OFF THE ESCALATOR AND HEAD FOR THE CAR.)



[ACT ONE SCENE B INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE AND KRAMER.]

GEORGE: You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.

ELAINE: So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?

GEORGE: Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.

JERRY: Big accomplishment.

GEORGE: Fish. What do they do?

ELAINE: What do you do?

KRAMER: It's this way.

GEORGE: What time is it?

JERRY: Five o'clock.

GEORGE: Always late. Always late.

JERRY: You're not late.

GEORGE: I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.

ELAINE: Who?

GEORGE: My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?

JERRY: Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.

ELAINE: Isn't it going the other way?

JERRY: There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.

ELAINE: But it's Saturday.

JERRY: You got the picnic and burger traffic.

GEORGE: I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

(KRAMER STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND.)

ELAINE: What's the matter?

(HE MUMBLES SOMETHING AND CONTINUES WALKING.)

JERRY: I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?

(KRAMER STUMBLES WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER.)

JERRY: (CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?

KRAMER: No, no, I got it.

(AND HE STUMBLES AGAIN. JERRY SPOTS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.)

JERRY: (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?

GEORGE: Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.

KRAMER: If you like her, go talk to her.

GEORGE: Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.

KRAMER: She's fat.

ELAINE: Oh she's fat?

KRAMER STOPS AGAIN, CONFUSED.

ELAINE: What? JERRY Where's the car?

KRAMER: I thought it was here.

GEORGE: You don't know where we parked?

(KRAMER LOOKS AROUND, THEN RESUMES WALKING. THEY FOLLOW.)

GEORGE: Oh, this is great.

KRAMER: Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.

JERRY: I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.

ELAINE: I didn't pay attention.

GEORGE: This is just what I need.

ELAINE: I'm sure it's right around here.

KRAMER: It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.

GEORGE: There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.

JERRY: It's over there. I know where it is.

(NOW JERRY TAKES THE LEAD AND THE OTHERS FOLLOW.)

ELAINE: It's black, right?

KRAMER: Dark blue.

GEORGE: (MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?

JERRY: There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.

THEY STOP...

JERRY: (CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...

KRAMER: Didn't we come in over there?

JERRY: I thought it was over there.

(FROM THERE P.O.V. THE CAMERA DOES A THREE SIXTY AND WE GET A SENSE OF HOW ENORMOUS THIS PLACE IS, THEN)

ELAINE: How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?

KRAMER: About two hours.

ELAINE: (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.

GEORGE: It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF:

GEORGE & ELAINE WITH KRAMER & JERRY BEHIND THEM.

JERRY: I really have to go to the bathroom.

KRAMER: Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J

ERRY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.

KRAMER: (CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.

JERRY: I'll wait.

KRAMER: You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?

JERRY: Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.

(ANGLE ON ELAINE AND GEORGE...)

ELAINE: (RE: CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.

(A CAR SCREECHES AROUND A CURVE, ELAINE IS UNNERVED.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.

GEORGE: ...Six wrong?

ELAINE: Those school zones are a killer.

JERRY: (TO KRAMER, RE:BOX) Will you let me help you with that?

KRAMER: I'm gonna put it down behind that car.

HE DOES SO.

JERRY: You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?

KRAMER: (TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.

GEORGE: Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.

ELAINE: (LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.

KRAMER: Look at this place. It's huge...

GEORGE: I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.

JERRY: Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."

GEORGE: Where the hell is this car, Kramer?

KRAMER: It's got to be here.

ELAINE: Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.

JERRY: Maybe it's not on this level.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?

ELAINE: It felt like a couple of levels.

JERRY: You should always carry a pad and pen.

GEORGE: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.

KRAMER: I have a pen.

THEY REACT...

JERRY: Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."

MOTHER: (O.C.) Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?

ELAINE: Look at that woman.

SHE'S HITTING HER BOY ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

MOTHER: I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.

GEORGE: (TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?

MOTHER: (TO GEORGE) Why don't you mind your own business?

GEORGE: I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.

KID: (TO GEORGE) You're ugly.

GEORGE: ...What?

KID: You're ugly.

GEORGE: You are!

KID: You are!

(THE KID GETS IN THE CAR. GEORGE IS STUNNED.)

GEORGE: I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.

KRAMER: (RE: CAR) I found it!

ELAINE: He's got it.

KRAMER: Oh...no.

JERRY: All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?

ELAINE: Jerry, look at my fish.

(JERRY HOLDS UP THE BAG AND HITS IT WITH HIS FINGER.)

JERRY: His eyes look a little cloudy.

GEORGE: Oh are they gonna be furious.

JERRY: Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!

KRAMER: It was easy the last time.

ELAINE: My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.

JERRY: No one's going to do that.

(ELAINE SPOTS A FORTY-ISH, STYLISH COUPLE WALKING TO THEIR CAR.)

ELAINE: Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.

MAN #1: (HOLDING HIS HANDS UP) ...Sorry.

ELAINE: Five minutes.

MAN #1: Can't do it.

ELAINE: We're not wilding.

THEY LEAVE.

(SHE APPROACHES TWO GIRLS - EARLY TWENTIES, MALL KIDS.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...

(THEY START LAUGHING.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?

(THEY IGNORE HER AND KEEP LAUGHING. CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.)

JERRY: Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?

KRAMER: Right here at the mall.

(BACK TO ELAINE, SEEKING OUT A MAN WITH A BEARD.)

ELAINE: Excuse me...

(HE IGNORES HER AND KEEPS WALKING.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.

(CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.)

JERRY: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.

KRAMER: You drank a whole bottle of water.

JERRY: I know.

KRAMER: So why don't you just go?

JERRY: No I can't.

KRAMER: Don't you get tired of following rules?

JERRY: You think I'm too cautious?

KRAMER: Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.

JERRY: Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.

KRAMER: Buddy Hackett?

JERRY: He's a comedian.

KRAMER: I know.

JERRY: All right. All right.

KRAMER: (pointing) You can go over here.

JERRY: I can manage.

KRAMER: (turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)

KRAMER: It'll take you ten seconds.

HE NUDGES JERRY.

JERRY: Okay, okay. I'll be right back.

(WE STAY WITH JERRY AS HE WALKS TO THE BACK OF A CAR, LOOKS AROUND LIKE SUPERMAN, THEN LETS FLY. HE FINISHES, ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS AND SEES A SECURITY GUARD STARING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED.)

SECURITY GUARD: Okay, let's go. Come with me.

JERRY: But...

SECURITY GUARD: Come on.

JERRY: (STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer

(END OF ACT ONE)



[ACT TWO SCENE C INT. SECURITY GUARD'S OFFICE - A SMALL ROOM WITH A DESK AND A CHAIR. JERRY PLEADS FOR HIS RELEASE.]

JERRY: I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.

SECURITY GUARD: Well you're still not allowed.

JERRY: Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?

SECURITY GUARD: That's up to you.

JERRY: So you don't care if I die.

SECURITY GUARD: What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.

JERRY: It was life and death.

SECURITY GUARD: Uh huh.

JERRY: Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.

SECURITY GUARD: I don't know.

JERRY: Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.

JERRY: (C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.

SECURITY GUARD: You can tell the police all about it.



[ACT TWO SCENE D INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE, KRAMER, AND ELAINE.]

KRAMER: (CALLING OUT) Jerry!

ELAINE: Jerry!

GEORGE: Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.

ELAINE: Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.

GEORGE: Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.

GEORGE: If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.

ELAINE: No, no, I'll be back.

(SHE LEAVES.)

GEORGE: Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.

KRAMER: Does that bother you?

GEORGE: Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?

KRAMER: Not at all.

GEORGE: See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?

KRAMER: I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?



[ACT TWO SCENE E INT. SECURITY OFFICE - JERRY AND THE SECURITY GUARD.]

JERRY: First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.

SECURITY GUARD: I know what you did.

JERRY: Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.

JERRY: (CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.

SECURITY GUARD: Yeah I'm sure.

JERRY: You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.



[ACT TWO SCENE F INT. PARKING GARAGE - ELAINE, LOOKING FOR JERRY. SHE'S TALKING TO AN OLDER BLACK MAN ABOUT TO GET IN HIS CAR.]

ELAINE: And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.

MAN #1: I can't do it.

ELAINE: But why? Why can't you do it?

MAN #1: I can't.

ELAINE: No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.

MAN #1: That's right.

ELAINE: But why? Why don't you want to?

MAN #1: I don't know.

ELAINE: But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?

MAN #:1 No, I wouldn't.



[ACT TWO SCENE G INT. SECURITY SHACK]

JERRY: (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.

JERRY: (CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.



[ACT TWO SCENE H INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE AND KRAMER, STILL LOOKING FOR THE CAR.]

KRAMER: The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.

GEORGE: (NOT INTERESTED) Really.

KRAMER: What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?

GEORGE: Who's Killer Kowalski?

KRAMER: He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.

GEORGE: I've gotta go to the bathroom.

KRAMER: So go. GEORGE Here?

KRAMER: (SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.

(GEORGE WALKS OUT OF THE FRAME AS KRAMER CONTINUES TO SCAN THE GARAGE. CUT TO GEORGE FINISHING UP. HE ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS, STARTLED. CUT TO THE SAME SECURITY GUARD, ARMS FOLDED, STARING AT HIM.)



[ACT TWO SCENE J INT. SECURITY OFFICE - GEORGE BEING LED IN BY THE SECURITY GUARD.]

GEORGE: Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...

SECURITY GUARD: Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?

JERRY: (TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?

GEORGE: (TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?



[ACT TWO SCENE K INT. PARKING GARAGE - KRAMER, WANDERING AIMLESSLY.]

KRAMER: George! George!


[ACT TWO SCENE L INT. PARKING GARAGE]

ELAINE: Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)



[ACT TWO SCENE M INT. PARKING GARAGE - JERRY AND GEORGE ARE BACK IN THE GARAGE EACH HOLDING THEIR SUMMONS.]

JERRY: Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.

JERRY: Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.

ELAINE: (O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!

ELAINE: (O.C.) Jerry! Over here...

(NOW THEY SPOT HER.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Where have you been?

JERRY: I was arrested for urinating.

GEORGE: (PROUDLY) Me too.

ELAINE: You what?

JERRY: I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.

ELAINE: Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...

JERRY: No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)

ELAINE: (DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.

MAN #2: Can't do it.

ELAINE: I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?

MAN #3: Sorry. (THEY KEEP WALKING.)

ELAINE: That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.

(THEY LOOK BACK AT HER.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?

GEORGE: Elaine, shut-up.

JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?

GEORGE: I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?

ELAINE: I thought he was with you.

GEORGE: See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...

(HE LOOKS AT JERRY'S WATCH AND THROWS HIS HANDS UP.)

GEORGE: (CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.

ELAINE: Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?

GEORGE: We came in over there!

ELAINE: We didn't come in over there!

JERRY: Where's Kramer?

(JERRY SEES THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN THEY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, AMY.)

JERRY: Hey George, there she is again. ...

GEORGE: So what do you want me to do?

JERRY: Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.

GEORGE: That is an opening.

(GEORGE TENTATIVELY APPROACHES HER...)

GEORGE: (CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...

AMY: Oh sure, I'll drive you around.

GEORGE: You will?

AMY: Sure.

(GEORGE WAVES FOR JERRY AND ELAINE.)

GEORGE: Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.

AMY: I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Filthy pigs.

(THEY ALL GET IN THE CAR.)

GEORGE: It's a blue Honda...

AMY: This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.

ELAINE: Hi, I'm Elaine.

JERRY: Jerry.

AMY: Hello.

ELAINE: It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.

AMY: I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy.

GEORGE: Hi Amy, I'm George.

(GEORGE TURNS TO THE BACK SEAT AND GIVES AND GIVE A, "HOW BOUT THIS?" LOOK.)



[ACT TWO SCENE N INT. PARKING GARAGE - MINUTES LATER LONG SHOT OF CAR - THE BRAKES SQUEAL AND THE CAR COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP, THEN GEORGE, ELAINE, AND JERRY GET OUT.]

GEORGE: (TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...

(SHE PULLS OUT, LEAVING RUBBER, THEN)

GEORGE: (CONT'D) ...with that group.

ELAINE: (SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?

JERRY: Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.

ELAINE: I'll say.

(THEY TURN TO GEORGE, WHO'S GAPING AT SOMETHING.)

ELAINE: What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!

JERRY: The car!

GEORGE: The car!

ELAINE: We found it. I can't believe it!

THEY WALK TO IT...SUDDENLY GEORGE STOPS.

GEORGE: Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!

JERRY: Kramer!

(THEY ALL SLUMP AGAINST THE CAR. ELAINE HOLDS UP HER FISH)



[ACT TWO SCENE P INT. PARKING GARAGE - ONE HOUR LATER SAME SHOT - BUT NO FISH. IN THE DISTANCE WE CAN MAKE OUT KRAMER STRUGGLING WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER. JERRY TAPS ELAINE WITH HIS ELBOW. ELAINE TAPS GEORGE. WE STAY ON KRAMER AS HE GETS CLOSER.]

JERRY: Kramer.

KRAMER: Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah, over here.

KRAMER: Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?

GEORGE: Purple 23.

KRAMER: Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.

GEORGE: Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.

(THEY GET IN THE CAR.)

KRAMER: What time is it?

GEORGE: Seven forty-five.

KRAMER: Well at least there's no traffic.

GEORGE: Right.

KRAMER: What time does that play start?

GEORGE: Eight o'clock.

KRAMER: That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...

(JERRY INDICATES HE SHOULDN'T PURSUE THAT.)

KRAMER: (CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?

SILENCE. HE STARTS UP THE CAR AND AS THEY HEAD OUT... FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO

You know there's like always one, location in your neighborhood, one store location that's constantly, changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, then it's a yogurt shop, then it's a pet supply. It's like constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in the mother ship from Close Encounters, the bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out, in a daze going ?I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you??
 

[George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says Grand opening.]

GEORGE: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't nice.

JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.

GEORGE: Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?

JERRY: What's that smell? What are you wearing?

GEORGE: What, a 'little' cologne.

JERRY: Manly.

GEORGE: Monica wants me to wear it.

JERRY: So why didn't you say no?

GEORGE: I'm too nice.

JERRY: Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.

GEORGE: She wants me to take an IQ test.

JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.

GEORGE: No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.

JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.

GEORGE: You know, I can't talk to you anymore.

JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.

GEORGE: Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.

JERRY: Who thinks you're smart?

GEORGE: I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.

JERRY: What thing?

GEORGE: You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!

JERRY: Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.

GEORGE: I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.

JERRY: What'd ya get?

GEORGE: What did I get or what do I say I got?

JERRY: What do you say?

GEORGE: I say fourteen o nine (1409).

JERRY: 1409, that's a good score.

GEORGE: Psst, You're telling me.

JERRY: What did you really get?

GEORGE: You are my friend.

JERRY: Of course.

GEORGE: I tell you everything, right?

JERRY: I hope so.

GEORGE: Well, this I take to the grave.
 
 

[Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars and Elaine is reading a newspaper.]

JERRY: He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.

ELAINE: Why do you keep watching?

JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second.

ELAINE: And then you flush.

JERRY: Well, it's a spider.

ELAINE: You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.

(Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.)

ELAINE: Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.

JERRY: Bazooka Joe.

(Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at and motions with his arm to Elaine who is closer to the door.)

JERRY: The buzzer.

ELAINE: It's your house.

JERRY: My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)

INTERCOM: It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

ELAINE: Casus belli.

JERRY: What's that?

ELAINE: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.

JERRY: Come on, Go in, go in!  [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]

ELAINE: Have you gone in there?

JERRY: No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.

(George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.)

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.

(Elaine sniffs around George.)

GEORGE: I'm wearing some cologne, all right?

ELAINE: Sure, fine.

JERRY: Casus belli.

ELAINE: Casus belli.

GEORGE: What's that?

ELAINE: Since when do you wear cologne?

GEORGE: Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.

JERRY: Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?

GEORGE: I didn't take it, yet.

(Elaine opens up the newspaper and starts leafing through it, reading some articles while still maintaining her part of the conversation)

ELAINE: What IQ test?

GEORGE: What's casus belli.

JERRY: Oh, it's nothing...

GEORGE: Is it about me?

JERRY: Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?

ELAINE: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?

JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like fun.

GEORGE: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.

ELAINE: You'll do well, you're smart.

JERRY: No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.

ELAINE: Wha'd you get on your SAT's?

GEORGE: It varies.

JERRY: You know, I don't even know my IQ.

ELAINE: huh, Mine's 145.

GEORGE: 145!

JERRY: Get out of here!

ELAINE: You get out of here!

JERRY: You get out of here!

ELAINE: Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)

GEORGE: Shst, You should take the test for me.

ELAINE: Huh.

JERRY: Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.

GEORGE: Haha (laughs)

JERRY: Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.  (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?

(Jerry tosses something to Elaine and she catches it)

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.

ELAINE: Are you serious?

GEORGE: Why not?

ELAINE: Where would I take the test?

GEORGE: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.

ELAINE: No, that'd be too noisy.

JERRY: Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.

ELAINE: Hey, what do you think?

JERRY: Hey, I love a good caper.

ELAINE: Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.

GEORGE: You'll do it?

ELAINE: What the hey.

GEORGE: Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu anxiously looking out the window. Jerry comes in.]

Babu Bhatt: Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

JERRY: Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.

BABU: Oh, ah how did you hear about us?

JERRY: Eh, people, people are talking.

BABU: Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both.

JERRY: Ah, non-smoking would be great.

BABU: Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot folded face cloth for your pleasure.

JERRY: Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]

BABU: Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.

JERRY: Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?

BABU: Oh, the turkey.

JERRY: Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.

BABU: You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...

JERRY: (thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
 
 

[George is taking a test in Monica's bedroom.]

GEORGE: You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.

MONICA: But why?

GEORGE: I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.

MONICA: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.

GEORGE: Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.

MONICA: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.

GEORGE: Well, I think you're wrong about that.  [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.

MONICA: Good luck.

GEORGE: Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)

(Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is waiting outside.)

ELAINE: What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.

GEORGE: I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.

ELAINE: All right, what time do you want me back here.

GEORGE: Ah, ah, twenty to three.

ELAINE: Ok.

GEORGE: Thanks again.

ELAINE: All right.

GEORGE: A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)

(George gives Elaine the thumbs up, closes the window and then gives her the OK sign.)
 
 

[Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for Jerry.]

JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.

BABU: It is in deed my pleasure.

JERRY: Oh, please...

(Elaine comes in carrying the envelope with the IQ test and a pencil in her mouth.)

BABU: Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. (runs to get a menu.) Our specials today...

ELAINE: Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)

BABU: Tea and toast.

JERRY: Eat something! Babu...

ELAINE: Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.

BABU: Oh, oh very good choice. Very good.

(Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.)

JERRY: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.

ELAINE: I know.

(Kramer comes in.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Oh boy. Woop...

(Kramer sitting down at the table next to Elaine - he sits a bit too hard and shakes the table -- silverware and plates rattle ... mustard bottle teetering - thus startling Elaine, who stops the test for a moment, but gets right back to it.)

KRAMER: Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...  (pats her on the shoulder twice.)

ELAINE: Hey.

KRAMER: This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.

JERRY: So?

KRAMER: Well, I'm not giving it back.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?

(Kramer takes some nachos and spills some of them on the IQ test.)

KRAMER: Oh, gees...

ELAINE: Ok,

KRAMER: You're all right

ELAINE: Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)

KRAMER: (eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?

JERRY: Statute.

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.

KRAMER: No, it's statue.

JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.

KRAMER: Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?

ELAINE: Statute.

KRAMER: Oh, I really think you're wrong.

ELAINE: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.

KRAMER: What test?

ELAINE: An IQ test.

KRAMER: Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?

ELAINE: It's for George.

KRAMER: George?

ELAINE: Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?

KRAMER: Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?

ELAINE: Would you please?!

KRAMER: What, is it for a job or something?

ELAINE: Later!

KRAMER: You're positive it's statute?

ELAINE: Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)

BABU: Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face towel for your... (gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams, Elaine screams and Kramer falls from his chair.  He gets up and is dazed)
 
 

[Monica's. George is reading a New Yorker on the bed and Monica is trying to get in. The door is locked.]

MONICA: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

MONICA: The door is locked.

GEORGE: Oh, it's locked?

MONICA: I need to get something.

GEORGE: Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)

MONICA: George!

GEORGE: Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu is cleaning and singing -- Jerry is seemingly enjoying Babu's singing as Elaine gets distracted from the IQ test.]

BABU: Nananeena, Ladadeeda, laadadeeda, saadina.... Laadadeeda sa saadina (singing too loud)

ELAINE: Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?

BABU: Set. ok

ELAINE: Set.

BABU: I'll get it ...

(Babu comes to collect dishes from Elaine's table and knocks down a cup of coffee.)

ELAINE: Oh my God! It's all over the test!

BABU: Oh, I did sc-I'm terribly sorry.

JERRY: Oh my God.

ELAINE: Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.

BABU: Please, forgive me, please...

JERRY: Go ahead, I'll take care of it.

ELAINE: Uhh.

BABU: (opens the door for Elaine) Please, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!

(Babu sits down at the table and Jerry sits down across from him)

JERRY: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.

BABU: You're a very kind man.

JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani, right?

BABU: Yes, Pakistani, yes.

JERRY: Babu, may I say something?

BABU: Of course, you're very smart man, I listen.

JERRY: I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.

BABU: But there are no Pakistani people here.

JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.

BABU: Yes, you see everything, don't you?

JERRY: Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.

BABU: I close down today and when I open again it'll be all Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you so much, you're very special person, very special.

(Babu leaves)

JERRY (thinking) I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?
 
 

[Elaine is giving the test back to George.]

ELAINE: It was an accident.

GEORGE: What did you go on a picnic?

ELAINE: Babu Bhatt did it.

GEORGE: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?

MONICA: Time's up George.

GEORGE: U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.

MONICA: How did you do?

GEORGE: Piece of cake; hu.

MONICA: What happened to the test?

GEORGE: What? Oh I spilled some food on it.

MONICA: Food? What food?

GEORGE: What are you talking about?

MONICA: Where did you get food?

GEORGE: From my pocket.

MONICA: Your pocket?

GEORGE: I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.

MONICA: And coffee?

GEORGE: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.

MONICA: Where did you get the coffee?

GEORGE: Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)

MONICA: How did you get there?

GEORGE: I walked.

MONICA: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.

GEORGE: I climbed out the window.

MONICA: You climbed out the window?

GEORGE: Of course.

MONICA: Why didn't you go out the door?

GEORGE: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.

MONICA: You're a fascinating man, George Costanza.

(George spreads his arms wide, elbows slightly bent -- his head bobbles a little bit.)
 
 

[Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is looking Dream cafe with binoculars. There's a sign on the window: Closed for renovation.]

JERRY: The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.

ELAINE: You're very special.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.

JERRY: Of course, I always do.

KRAMER: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.

ELAINE: Just give it back to him.

KRAMER: Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)

(Jerry sees George from the window.)

JERRY: Hey Georgie!

GEORGE: Coming up.

JERRY: How'd you do on the IQ test?!

GEORGE: 85!

JERRY: What?!!

GEORGE: 85, Jerry! 85 IQ !

(Jerry laughs, pounding the window sill 3 times with his open palm.)

ELAINE: 85?

JERRY: Well, well, well...

ELAINE: He's coming up?

JERRY: Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.

ELAINE: Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.

JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...

(George comes in looking angry.)

GEORGE: Oh, hello Professor.

ELAINE: George, I cannot believe...

GEORGE: Please...

ELAINE: No there has got be a mistake.

GEORGE: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

JERRY: But an 85?

ELAINE: Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.

JERRY (mocking) It was a madhouse.

ELAINE: Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.

GEORGE: Ooh ho hoo, forget it.

ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?

GEORGE: You could do worse!

ELAINE: No, no, come on. I guarantee it.

GEORGE: All right, I'll ask her.

ELAINE: Ok, now where I'm going to take it.

JERRY: Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu is at the window looking gloomy. Jerry comes in.]

JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.

BABU: You see how I listen. I work very hard, borrow more money.

JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.

BABU: You wish to eat?

JERRY: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.

BABU: Very good.

JERRY (thinking) Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great.
 

[Jerry's apartment. Elaine is finishing the test.]



[Monica's bedroom. George is pacing the room.]
 


[Jerry's monologue.]

You know the IQ test, an they always have that sample question at the beginning where they show you how to fill in the circle. This should be the first elimination point right there. Anybody goes outside that circle,... ?Yeah, you wanna come with us please.   Yeah, yeah you're done, your test is over, you went outside the circle ok??
 


[Jerry's apartment. Elaine finishes the test, slaps down the pencil and stuffs the test back in the envelope.  She checks her watch for the time, stretches her arms above her head.]

ELAINE: (stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.

(Kramer charges in and locks the door behind him.)

ELAINE: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.

ELAINE: What's going on?

MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Hey, Kramer! I saw you go there! I'm not leaving until you gimme that jacket. (Bangs on the door) Open up Kramer!

ELAINE: Wha'd you come in here for?

KRAMER: Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.

(3 more Bangs on the door)

ELAINE: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.

KRAMER: I thought you took the test.

ELAINE: I had to take it again.

KRAMER: How come?

ELAINE: What's the difference?!!

(3 more Bangs on the door)

KRAMER: Well, you can't leave now.

ELAINE: What?

MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!

KRAMER: Never!

(4 more Bangs on the door)
 
 

[Monica's apartment. George is looking out the window.  3 light knocks on the bedroom door]

MONICA: Come on George, open up.

(George anxious and quietly frustrated -- he reluctantly opens the door.)

MONICA: Well?

(George shakes her hand and clasping his left hand over hers -- creating a hand sandwich.)

GEORGE: How' you doing?

MONICA: Where's the test?

GEORGE: Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu is looking at Jerry as he eats.]

JERRY: Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?

BABU: The shrimp is stringy?

JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator...

BABU: Quiet!!

JERRY: No I...

BABU: You shut up!

JERRY: Well I...

BABU: You make me change restaurant, but nobody come! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!

JERRY: You know, I think I'll just take the check.

BABU: You bad man! You very very bad man! [leaves]

JERRY: (thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
 


[Monica's. Elaine is gently tapping on the bedroom window. Monica comes to open it.]

MONICA: Are you looking for George?

ELAINE: Well eh, kind of....

MONICA: George left.

ELAINE: Oh.

MONICA: Is, that the test?

ELAINE: Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.

MONICA: Thanks. I hope you do a lot better this time.

ELAINE: Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
 


[At the street. Dream Cafe has a Closed sign on the window and men are carrying furniture out.]



[George, Jerry and Kramer are standing across the street. Kramer has no jacket on.]

JERRY: You know what it was, bad location.

GEORGE: Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.

JERRY: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?

KRAMER: h-Yeah...

JERRY: Oh, sorry.

KRAMER: I'm going upstairs.

(Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: Hey guys...

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.

JERRY: 151?

ELAINE: Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)

GEORGE: That's a good score.

JERRY: So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?

GEORGE: Italian.

ELAINE: No, Chinese.

JERRY: You know, what would be great?

(George and Elaine give Jerry a long look.)
 
 

[Closing monologue.]

It's tough to do a good deed. Let's look at your professional good deed doers. Your Lone Rangers, your Superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They're all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, yeah, thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm rentin' here, They got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?"

JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.


[Jerry's apartment]

(A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry doing work with headphones on.)

REPAIRMAN: .....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.

JERRY: Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )

REPAIRMAN: So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration

JERRY: Oh! well whatever you have to do.

REPAIRMAN: I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.

JERRY: (sarcastically) No you don't..

(George enters the apartment.)

GEORGE: Hey! what are listening to?

JERRY: My show from last night.

GEORGE: Oh! you taped it?

JERRY: Yeah , I was doing new material.

GEORGE: Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .

JERRY: Huh?

GEORGE: Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.

JERRY: The" coup dé-toe"

GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.

GEORGE: Need to use the phone.

JERRY: Who you calling?

GEORGE: China.

JERRY: China really?

GEORGE: Yeah. I'll pay for it.

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.

JERRY: Hair?

GEORGE: The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.

JERRY: Done what?

GEORGE: Discovered a cure for baldness.

REPAIRMAN: Did you see that last night?

GEORGE: It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.

JERRY: (to Kramer) What's this?

KRAMER: Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.

GEORGE: Is that the guy who likes fat women?

JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.

KRAMER: (to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.

GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.

KRAMER: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there

JERRY: Oh! my God!....

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.

GEORGE: (George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...

KRAMER: Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)

GEORGE: Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?

JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.

GEORGE: This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?

KRAMER: All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)

GEORGE: WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?

JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.

GEORGE: My god!!!

KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.

GEORGE: All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?

JERRY: Good question.

KRAMER: Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!


[Cut to Monks]

GEORGE: What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?

JERRY: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

ELAINE: Hi boys.

BOTH: Hello...

ELAINE: What's happening?

JERRY: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.

GEORGE: This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......

JERRY: (pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!

GEORGE: What??

JERRY: The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.

GEORGE: I thought you meant the..

JERRY: No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.

ELAINE: What did she say?

PETER: Seinfeld.....( from way in the back of the restaurant. Cheesy plot device to have Jerry leave the table for a minute so George and Elaine can talk)

JERRY: Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)

ELAINE: So did you hear this message?

GEORGE: Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable

ELAINE: Really!

GEORGE: Yeah. I can't get over it.

ELAINE: Huh! Sexy?

GEORGE: This woman drove us out of our minds

ELAINE: Like ...humm...How did she sound?

GEORGE: She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.

ELAINE: Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....

GEORGE: Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....

ELAINE: Shhhhhh!!!

ELAINE: I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?

GEORGE: Oh! no no nothing....

ELAINE: Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.

GEORGE: I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..

ELAINE: Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?

GEORGE: Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing

(Jerry comes back)

JERRY: Remember Peter?

GEORGE: Peter?

JERRY: You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.

ELAINE: So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?

JERRY: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.

ELAINE: Oh! really.

JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.

ELAINE: So what, Are you gonna ask her out.

JERRY: No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.

ELAINE: Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.

GEORGE: Wh.. Where you going?

ELAINE: Home.

GEORGE: Why you going home for?

ELAINE: Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.

JERRY: Sure.


[Back to Jerry's]

GEORGE: Oh! my god. Oh! man...

JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.

ELAINE: (coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.

GEORGE: (phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?

JERRY: Why are you doing this?

GEORGE: Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.

JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: You know what that makes you?...A baldist.

GEORGE: Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?

KRAMER: So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?

GEORGE: In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.

KRAMER: That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?

GEORGE: (visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.

KRAMER: So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?

PING: (continues his phone call) Ha Pachini fair pousher pousher mouist I fai chin fousher...

JERRY: (as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.

[Back to Jerry's.]

JERRY: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...

KRAMER: What is that?

JERRY: That's my cockney accent.

KRAMER: Naw ,na , that's no good.

JERRY: Lets hear yours.

KRAMER: Not bloody likely..

JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.

GEORGE: Guess, what I got.

JERRY: Oh! Is that the bald stuff?

GEORGE: From China. All the way from China.

KRAMER: Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.

GEORGE: No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.

JERRY: Yes I am skeptical.

GEORGE: Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.

KRAMER: W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.

JERRY: No kidding?

KRAMER: He's in jail.

JERRY: What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?

KRAMER: That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)

JERRY: You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?

KRAMER: It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.

JERRY: How long are you suppose to leave it on for?

GEORGE: All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)

JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: It's Elaine Marie Benes.

JERRY: Well Hello..

ELAINE: Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?

JERRY: Yes , I got her number.

GEORGE: Is that Elaine?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: HI ELAINE...

ELAINE: I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?

JERRY: Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business

ELAINE: Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?

GEORGE: Did she say Hello?

JERRY: What? I dunno.

GEORGE: I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?

JERRY: I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.

GEORGE: Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?

JERRY: She's coming up.

GEORGE: Elaine's coming up?

JERRY: Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)

KRAMER: How often do you cut your toe nails?

JERRY: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.

KRAMER: 'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.

JERRY: The big toe; The captain.

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?

JERRY: That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.

(As Jerry dials the girls number, George races to the bathroom one more time.)

ALICIA: Hello.

JERRY: Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.

ALICIA: Yeah.

JERRY: This is Jerry Seinfeld.


[Back to Jerry's after an implied date with Alicia]

JERRY: (to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.

KRAMER: I know how to handle these psychotics.

(George comes in wearing a huge cowboy hat.)

JERRY: Sheriff?........What's with the hat?

GEORGE: Kramer, can we do this later..

KRAMER: No, I got the tape right here.

JERRY: Kramer, let's do this later.

KRAMER: (ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.

GEORGE: Really? ..You think.

JERRY: Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.

KRAMER: 'bout what?

JERRY: It's kinda private.

KRAMER: Like the big toe captain..

GEORGE: So now you're doing my bits?

JERRY: I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!

KRAMER: Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)

JERRY: Does she know?

GEORGE: Because I promised her.

JERRY: I thought you just said she doesn't know??

GEORGE: She doesn't.

JERRY: So how can you promise her?

GEORGE: Because she asked me to.

JERRY: What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?

GEORGE: All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.

JERRY: What, Elaine?

GEORGE: Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.

JERRY: (picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...

GEORGE: Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)

JERRY: Wait a second. .Just give me a second

GEORGE: You heard it fifty times already.

JERRY: She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence

(Door Buzzer)

JERRY: Yeaaaah!!!

ELAINE: (Concerned) What's the matter?

JERRY: Oooh! I got a pain in my side.

ELAINE: (to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)

JERRY: What are you doing here?

ELAINE: I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.

JERRY: I know, George told me.

ELAINE: You told him!!!!

GEORGE: He..He threatened me.

JERRY: Where did you come up with all that stuff?

ELAINE: That was nothing.

GEORGE: Elaine.. I have to tell you something...

JERRY: George NO!!

GEORGE: No no no no no no no..

JERRY: George I'm telling ya..

ELAINE: What is it?

GEORGE: I'm very attracted to you..

JERRY: Aye......

(Kramer comes in and yells)

KRAMER: I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.

GEORGE: Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...

KRAMER: Whoa!!!....That was you?

ELAINE: It was a joke...

KRAMER: Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.

ELAINE: Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...

GEORGE: Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.

JERRY: It's early.

KRAMER: We'll order Chinese.

(She leaves and they all scramble for the tape recorder.)

Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to be two-and-a-half feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, I'd like to get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm allowed up here."


[Jerry and George are at a newsstand]

GEORGE: Where'd you meet her?

JERRY: I met her on an elevator.

GEORGE: On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?

JERRY: Impossible, right?

GEORGE: You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?

JERRY: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.

GEORGE: Wow. What'd you say?

(flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator)

JERRY: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.

(end of flashback)

GEORGE: Wow.

JERRY: Can you believe I did that?

GEORGE: What did she say?

(another flashback)

ISABEL: What crop circles?

(end of flashback)

JERRY: Not a good sign.

GEORGE: Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?

NEWSSTAND OWNER: Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?

JERRY: You got something in your teeth there.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: It's green.

GEORGE: Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.

JERRY: Did you bump into anybody you knew?

GEORGE: I had a job interview.

JERRY: How'd it go?

GEORGE: Take a guess.

(flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's spinached teeth.)

INTERVIEWER: Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.

GEORGE: Ok, thanks.

(end of flashback)

JERRY: What do you need a job, you got Audrey.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: What's the matter?

GEORGE: Oh, nothing.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: You won't think I'm a bad person?

JERRY: Too late for that.

GEORGE: 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.

JERRY: Yeah, she's got a big nose.

GEORGE: I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.

(momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose)

JERRY: It's a schnoz.

GEORGE: Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.

JERRY: A little.

GEORGE: So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.

JERRY: Stop being so concerned with looks.

(momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number)

JERRY: Have you said anything to her about it?

GEORGE: I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.

JERRY: Alright, shut up, here they come.

GEORGE: (waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.


[Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.

ELAINE: Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?

KRAMER: No no, he's never met her. She's in California.

ELAINE: Are you coming with me?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.

GEORGE: Why don't you just commit yourself already?

AUDREY: What is so special about this jacket?

ELAINE: He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.

AUDREY: What's the smudge on your hand?

KRAMER: Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.

GEORGE: What, you didn't wash all day?

KRAMER: Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.

AUDREY: It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.

KRAMER: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.

ELAINE: Kramer!

KRAMER: What? What?

ELAINE: How could you say something like that?!

KRAMER: What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.

ELAINE: No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.

AUDREY: No, it's ok.

ELAINE: What did you have to say that for?

KRAMER: Well, I was just trying to help out.

ELAINE: Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.

KRAMER: You see what happens when you try to be nice?


[Middle Monologue]

But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." "That's ok, your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you very much."


[George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment]

AUDREY: Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?

GEORGE: Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?

AUDREY: You look like you've got something on your mind.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?

AUDREY: How about him?

GEORGE: They way he just says stuff.

AUDREY: He sure does.

GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.

AUDREY: So, what did you think?

GEORGE: About the pizza?

AUDREY: No, about the nose job.

GEORGE: Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?

AUDREY: Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.

GEORGE: Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.

AUDREY: I know, they're good.

GEORGE: Peter Jennings had one.

AUDREY: Really?

GEORGE: Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...

AUDREY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.

AUDREY: I hate the dentist.

GEORGE: It's a cleaning.

AUDREY: So you really think I should do this?

GEORGE: If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.

AUDREY: Well, maybe I should.

GEORGE: What the hell.

ELAINE: (barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?

GEORGE: Me? I didn't say anything.

ELAINE: You encouraged her to get one.

GEORGE: I didn't encourage. No encourage.

ELAINE: Peter Jennings had one?

GEORGE: It's possible.

ELAINE: Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.

AUDREY: No, George is right. I want to get one.

ELAINE: I think it's a mistake.

GEORGE: Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.

 
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop]

GEORGE: I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.

JERRY: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.

GEORGE: (checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.

JERRY: We have time.

GEORGE: It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.

JERRY: It is exciting.

GEORGE: Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...

JERRY: Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.

GEORGE: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.

JERRY: Then what?

GEORGE: He still wins but it's not a blowout.

JERRY: She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.

(flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: (holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.

KRAMER: (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.

(end of flashback)

JERRY: So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.

GEORGE: Good for you.

JERRY: I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.

GEORGE: It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.

JERRY: It's not like that at all.

 
[Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: How do you even know the jacket is there?

KRAMER: Well I don't, I'm guessing.

GEORGE: Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,

AUDREY: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

AUDREY: Enough.

JERRY: Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.

ELAINE: Are you sure you want us here for this?

AUDREY: Yes.

JERRY: Shouldn't a doctor do it?

AUDREY: No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.

GEORGE: Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.

(Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their horror.)

ELAINE: It looks good.

JERRY: Great job.

KRAMER: You got butchered.

(George faints)

(An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.)

JERRY: Let's put him over here.

KRAMER: (to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?

AUDREY: (with hand covering nose) To the doctor!

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.

(Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George.)

ELAINE: How ya feeling?

GEORGE: Too much salt in my diet.

ELAINE: Can I get you anything?

GEORGE: Nah, I'm good.

ELAINE: You sure? Anything?

GEORGE: Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?

ELAINE: No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

GEORGE: It's like, all dented.

ELAINE: Seems to be.

GEORGE: Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--

ELAINE: Shut up, George.

GEORGE: Shut up?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Interesting.

 
[Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal, Jerry has cracked.]

JERRY: Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!

KRAMER: I don't have it, I threw it out.

JERRY: You're lying! You got it, I want that number!

KRAMER: I told you, I threw it out.

JERRY: Give it to me!

KRAMER: You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.

JERRY: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.

KRAMER: You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.

JERRY: I was lying, give it to me!

KRAMER: No, you told me not to!

JERRY: I want that number!

KRAMER: Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!

(Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl, then storms out again.)


[George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose, George is trying not to look at it.]

AUDREY: The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...

GEORGE: Yeah.

AUDREY: You see this perinasal sinus cavity?

GEORGE: Oh, I got it.

AUDREY: You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.

GEORGE: Yeah, phew.

AUDREY: So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?

GEORGE: What?

AUDREY: Remember we talked about taking a trip together?

GEORGE: We did?

AUDREY: Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?

GEORGE: Hawaii?

AUDREY: Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.

GEORGE: (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.

AUDREY: I never heard that.

GEORGE: Oh yeah. My friend lived there.

AUDREY: We could go to the Caribbean.

GEORGE: You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.

AUDREY: George, I don't think this is working.


[Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.]

ISABEL: Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.

JERRY: I'm Nelson!

ISABEL: That's not the line, Jerry.

JERRY: Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.

ISABEL: I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.

JERRY: Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.

ISABEL: Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.

JERRY: (to himself: Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.

(Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.)

JERRY'S BRAIN: Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?

JERRY'S PENIS: Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!

JERRY'S BRAIN: I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.

JERRY'S PENIS: Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.

JERRY'S BRAIN: What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.

JERRY'S PENIS: Oh, go read a book.

JERRY'S BRAIN: Enough chatting, let's play.


[Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.]

ELAINE: You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.

KRAMER: (filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?

ELAINE: Yeah.

KRAMER: Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.

ELAINE: What do I need this for?

KRAMER: Because we're engaged.

ELAINE: We're engaged?

KRAMER: Um hm.

ELAINE: Kramer, this is too big.

KRAMER: (lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.

(A stout man walks around the corner.)

LANDLORD: Hello?

ELAINE: Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.

LANDLORD: Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?

KRAMER: Yes, yes I am.

LANDLORD: I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.

KRAMER: Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.

LANDLORD: Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?

KRAMER: My contention?

LANDLORD: Yes, your contention.

KRAMER: Yes, that's my contention.

ELAINE: I heard him contend that.

LANDLORD: It's too bad about your father.

ELAINE: Oh, it was a frame-up.

LANDLORD: A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.

ELAINE: Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.

KRAMER: She does fine work.

LANDLORD: Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.

ELAINE: How kind of you.

LANDLORD: You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.

(Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.)

(Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have the upper hand.)

JERRY'S BRAIN: What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!

ISABEL: Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.

JERRY'S PENIS: It's killing me. (Makes a move)

JERRY'S BRAIN: That's your move?

JERRY'S PENIS: Yeah.

JERRY'S BRAIN: Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!

JERRY'S PENIS: (beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!

(Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop)

JERRY'S BRAIN: (before disappearing himself) Punk.

JERRY: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.

(Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face)

 

[Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment]

ELAINE: Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.

LANDLORD: He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.

ELAINE: My father, really? I had no idea.

LANDLORD: Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs

Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken stumblebum.

KRAMER: You don't say?

ELAINE: I found it!

LANDLORD: The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!"

(Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated. Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.)

 
[The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.]

KRAMER: So I grabbed the guy by the collar.

ELAINE: Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"

JERRY: So I assume the jig was up.

ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much.

(Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful)

AUDREY: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hey.

AUDREY: (to George) Hello.

GEORGE: (smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!

AUDREY: (motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.

ELAINE: So, will I see you later tonight?

AUDREY: Not sure.

KRAMER: (rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?

AUDREY: (holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.

KRAMER: Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.

ELAINE: (after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--

GEORGE: (interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.


[Closing Monologue]

The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to perform a cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."

So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication.  You ever try and pick one of these out?  It's not easy.  It's a wall.  It's an entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright, alright, alright, okay, what the hell--  This is quick acting, but this is long lasting.  When do I need to feel good, now or later?"  It's a tough question. And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong with the guy, you know?  They always show you, like, all the problems that he's having.  First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this guy.  No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public.  And he's always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him. I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?"  "Yes I am."  "Are you having any lightning with the pain?"


[Jerry and George are in a drug store.]

JERRY:  How did you get fleas?

GEORGE:  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.

JERRY:  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.

GEORGE:  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?

JERRY:  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"

GEORGE:  You know Ava's gonna be there.

JERRY:  Who?

GEORGE:  The nice one that works in my office.

JERRY:  Nah.

GEORGE:  I'll drive.

JERRY:  Oh, well, now you're talking.

GEORGE:  It's supposed to be a good party.

JERRY:  What does that mean, good dip?

GEORGE:  No, there'll be girls there.

JERRY:  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?

GEORGE:  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between these two?  (They each grab a box and check the ingredients)  You got propylparabin?

JERRY:  Got it.

GEORGE:  You got isobutane-30?

JERRY:  I got isobutane-20.

GEORGE:  A-ha.

JERRY:  You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?

GEORGE:  Got it.

JERRY:  I have aloe!

GEORGE:  You got aloe?  I love aloe.

JERRY:  Where do they make yours?

GEORGE:  Jersey.

JERRY:  White Plains.

(George puts down the "Jersey" box and grabs the "White Plains" box from Jerry and they go to the check out counter.  Two women are standing at the magazine rack in the background.)

JERRY:  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.  What's the matter?

GEORGE:  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.

JERRY:  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.

GEORGE: (to the cashier)  Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.

CASHIER:  You gave me a ten.

GEORGE:  I'm positive I gave you a twenty.

CASHIER:  I know what you gave me.

GEORGE:  You owe me ten dollars.

CASHIER:  Will you please step aside?  Next?

GEORGE:  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--

CASHIER:  You.

GEORGE:  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.

SECURITY GUARD:  What's the problem here?

GEORGE:  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.

CASHIER:  He's claiming short.

SECURITY GUARD:  Alright, let's just take it outside.

GEORGE:  Oh, so you don't believe me either?

SECURITY GUARD:  Come on, let's go.

GEORGE:  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.


[George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door]

ELAINE:  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.

JERRY:  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.

GEORGE: (waving:  Eva.

(A beautiful woman starts walking over.)

JERRY:  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.

AVA:  So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.

GEORGE:  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?

AVA:  Yesterday

GEORGE:  I don't believe it.

AVA:  Ask Mark.

GEORGE:  Mark, is this true?

(A man across the room nods.  George and Ava walk towards him.)

JERRY:  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.

ELAINE:  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.

JERRY:  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.

ELAINE:  How old are you?

JERRY:  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting.

ELAINE:  Whatever you want.

(Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.)

GUY:  You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?

JERRY:  Yeah, yeah I did.

GUY:  So what do you do?

JERRY: (Patting his head:  I'm a comedian.

GUY:  Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?

JERRY: (still Patting)  I hear a voice.

GUY:  What kind of voice?

JERRY:  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.

GUY:  How come you keep tapping your head.

JERRY:  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.

(Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.)

GUY:  On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for something.

(Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.)

GUY:  Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.

(Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.)

GUY:  I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.

ELAINE:  Yeah, me too.

GUY:  Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.

(Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.)

GEORGE:  How's it going?

JERRY:  Great, how about you?

GEORGE:  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.

JERRY:  How do you account for this?

GEORGE:  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.

JERRY:  Well, she obviously liked you all along.

GEORGE:  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."

JERRY:  Anyway, I'm ready to go.

GEORGE:  Now?

JERRY:  If not now, when?

GEORGE:  Gimme a half-hour.

JERRY:  Okay, half-hour.

(Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from tapping.)

GUY:  Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...

JERRY: (interrupting)  Can I talk to you for a second?

ELAINE:  Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.

JERRY:  Hey, I was dying over there.

ELAINE:  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.

(Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.)

ELLEN:  Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?

JERRY:  Right.

ELLEN:  Yeah, I remember you.

(Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch near a pretentious woman.)

WOMAN:  I wonder what happened to my fiancé.  I know he's here somewhere. Ellen?  Have you seen my fiancé?

ELLEN:  He's upstairs.

WOMAN:  Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.  I havelost my fiancé, the poor baby.

ELAINE:  Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

WOMAN:  What?

ELAINE:  The dingo ate your baby!

(Cut to George and Jerry.)

JERRY:  You ready?

GEORGE:  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.

JERRY:  I do favors.

GEORGE:  I think something's happening here.

JERRY:  What?

GEORGE:  I think she wants me to take her home.

JERRY:  Wow.

GEORGE:  What should I do?

JERRY:  Go!  What could you do?

GEORGE:  What about you and Elaine?

JERRY:  We'll get a ride.

GEORGE:  Are you sure?

JERRY:  We'll be fine, what did she say?

GEORGE:  She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes)  She told me she wants me to make love to her.

JERRY:  What?  She said that?

GEORGE:  Yeah.

JERRY:  Get out of here.

GEORGE:  I swear.

JERRY:  What did you say?

GEORGE:  I, I, I can't.

JERRY:  What did you say?

GEORGE:  Please, it's--

JERRY:  What?

GEORGE:  I... I... I long for you.

JERRY:  I long for you?

GEORGE:  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.

JERRY:  It's okay, that's not bad.

GEORGE:  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.

JERRY:  Really?

GEORGE:  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?

JERRY:  Oh, come on.

GEORGE:  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.

JERRY:  George, you're thinking too much.

GEORGE:  I know, I know, I can't stop it!

(Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.)

ELAINE:  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.

JERRY: (walking up)  Pendant?  Those bastards.

ELAINE:  Excuse me.

JERRY:  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office

ELAINE:  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?

JERRY:  Uh, no, he's taking the car.

ELAINE:  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?

JERRY:  I don't know.

ELAINE:  You don't know?

JERRY:  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

ELAINE:  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?

JERRY:  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.


[Middle monologue]

All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  This is the male code.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad.  They hold that countdown.  He's leaning against the rocket talking to her, "So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"


[Still at the Party]

ELAINE: (noticing Ava in a fur)  Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?

JERRY:  Yeah, yeah, alright.

ELAINE:  I can't believe she's walking around in that.

JERRY:  Just don't make a scene.

ELAINE:  Hey, is that real fur?

JERRY:  Oh boy.

AVA:  It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.

GEORGE:  Yeah, good night.

ELAINE:  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?

GEORGE:  Could we talk about this some other time?

AVA:  Are you a vegetarian?

JERRY:  Here we go.

ELAINE:  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.

AVA:  So you're a hypocrite.

GEORGE:  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-

AVA:  Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.

ELAINE:  Fish don't feel any pain.

AVA:  How do you know?  Do you communicate with fish?

ELAINE:  Well, they're not kept in little cages.

AVA:  Ever seen a goldfish?

GEORGE:  Goldfish.

ELAINE:  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.

AVA:  Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life.  (To George)  Let's go.

ELAINE:  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!

GEORGE:  That's why we're here in America.

JERRY:  You're beautiful.

ELAINE:  Call Kramer.

JERRY:  Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, this is your party, right?

STEVE:  No, I just live here.

JERRY:  Can I use your phone?

STEVE:  What's in it for me?

JERRY:  A bigger bill?

STEVE:  He he, go for it.

(Jerry picks up the phone and dials.)

JERRY:  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.

(Cut to several hours later.  The party has ended.  The hosts, Steve and Jenny, are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.)

ELAINE:  You sure you don't need any help?

JENNY:  No, not really.

JERRY:  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

JENNY: (To Steve)  I want them out of here.

ELAINE:  Call him again.

JERRY:  I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.

JENNY: (To Steve)  It's two o'clock in the morning.

JERRY: (noticing a coffee table book)  Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.

ELAINE:  Six hundred and twenty million people died.

JERRY:  Thousand.

ELAINE:  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror. (To Jerry)  The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the right directions?

JERRY:  Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's nothing we can do?

JENNY:  No!  (To Steve)  I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.

JERRY:  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.

ELAINE:  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.

JENNY:  You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.

JERRY:  Oh, he's coming.

JENNY:  Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.

(Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.)

JERRY:  That's him.

JENNY:  I'm going to bed!

ELAINE:  Thanks a lot.

JERRY:  Thanks, great party.

(As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.)

KRAMER:  Hey, how ya doing?

STEVE:  Ah, look who's here.

KRAMER:  I'm sorry.

JERRY:  Hey, it's okay.

KRAMER:  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.

ELAINE:  Then how did you find the place?

KRAMER:  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.  8173.

JERRY:  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.

STEVE:  No problem.

JERRY:  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.

STEVE:  Hey, I might take you up on that.

JERRY: (writing)  Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.

KRAMER: (to Elaine)  You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.

ELAINE:  But it's cold out.

KRAMER:  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.


[Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.]

JERRY:  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.

(Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.)

JERRY:  Who is it?

VOICE:  Mr. Pocatello.

JERRY:  Who?

VOICE:  You mean you don't recognize my voice?

(Jerry opens the door.  Steve steps in.)

STEVE:  Jerry, baby!

JERRY:  Do I know you?

STEVE:  Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.

JERRY:  I'm sorry, uh-

STEVE:  See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.

JERRY:  Oh, okay.

STEVE:  You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.

JERRY:  You certainly are.  What's going on?

STEVE:  I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.

JERRY:  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.

STEVE:  Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.

JERRY:  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.

STEVE:  I understand.

JERRY:  Look, you can hang out here if you want.

STEVE:  Don't be so enthusiastic.

JERRY:  No, it's-

STEVE:  I'm not gonna steal anything.

JERRY:  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.

STEVE:  I think I can do that.

JERRY:  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.

STEVE:  Yeah.  Let's have lunch.


[Jerry and George are at the drug store.]

JERRY:  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.

GEORGE:  Yeah, me either.

JERRY:  Oh, come on.

GEORGE:  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?

JERRY:  I've never had a job.

GEORGE:  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.

JERRY:  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?

GEORGE:  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'

JERRY:  What are you gonna do?

GEORGE:  I have no choice, I'm quitting.


[Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV.  Kramer walks in and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.]

KRAMER:  The party, Long Island?

STEVE:  Kramer, right?

KRAMER:  Hey, what are you doing here?

STEVE:  I'm waiting for my ride.

KRAMER:  Where's Jerry?

STEVE:  He split.  Let me ask you something.  Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?

KRAMER:  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.  (Sensing Steve's disappointment)  Well, but I might have something.


[Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.  Jerry is selecting medication.]

JERRY:  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.

GEORGE:  How much is that?

JERRY:  Nine sixty.

GEORGE:  Nine sixty?  Give it to me.

JERRY:  Why?

GEORGE:  Don't worry, I got it.

JERRY:  What do you mean, you got it?

GEORGE:  I got it.

(George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket)

JERRY:  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're stealing this, aren't you?

GEORGE:  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.

JERRY:  You're a lunatic.

GEORGE:  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.

JERRY:  What do you say to a person like you?

GEORGE:  Just walk.

JERRY:  Oh.

(A security guard approaches George.)

SECURITY GUARD:  Scuse me.  What do you got there?

GEORGE:  What?

SECURITY GUARD:  What do you got in your shirt?

GEORGE:  Oh, I was gonna pay for this.

SECURITY GUARD: (grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me.

GEORGE: (nervous)  Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.

CASHIER: um-hmm.

SECURITY GUARD:  You don't think I remember you?

GEORGE: (more nervous)  What are you talking about?

SECURITY GUARD:  I know who you are, I was watching you.

GEORGE: (panicky)  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?

(The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.)

JERRY:  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?


[Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.  Kramer is in the middle of a story.]

KRAMER:  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!

(They both erupt in raucous laughter.)

STEVE: (hysterical)  Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?

KRAMER:  Not really.

STEVE:  Maybe we should call one of those escort services.  I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.

KRAMER: (handing Steve the phone)  555-LOVE.

STEVE:  Hey, you want in on this?

KRAMER:  No, I got a girl in the next building


[Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's voice from inside.]

VOICE:  Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it.  Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do.

STEVE: (drunk and slurring)  Oh Jerry!  Jerry!  Look who's here, it's Jerry

JERRY:  What the hell?

STEVE:  Jerry, this is Patti.

JERRY:  Nice to meet you.

PATTI:  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.

JERRY:  What the hell is going on here?

STEVE:  I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.  (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.

PATTI:  I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.

STEVE:  See ya, Jerr.  And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.

JERRY:  Oh, Kramer huh?

STEVE:  Yeah, he's a hoot.  Oh, goodbye, my dear.  (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away)  Ouch.  (To Jerry)  Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.

(Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.)

PATTI:  I ain't leaving.

JERRY:  Patti?

PATTI:  You got anything to drink?

JERRY:  Alright, how much does he owe you?

PATTI:  Fifty dollars.

JERRY: (taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly)  Fifty dollars.

(In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.)

COP:  This your apartment?

JERRY:  Yeah, but--

COP:  You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.

JERRY:  Wait a second, I--

(Elaine walks in.)

ELAINE:  I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti)  Is that real fur?

JERRY & COP:  Oh boy.


[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.]

GEORGE:  You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.

JERRY:  He was a nice guy.

GEORGE:  Oh, great guy.

JERRY:  Was there a red-headed guy there?

GEORGE:  The one with the long sideburns?

JERRY:  Yeah.

GEORGE:  Where does he come off?

JERRY:  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.

GEORGE:  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.

JERRY:  Oh, we all hated him.


[Closing monologue]

There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor.  You can measure the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do me a favor.'  Small favor, small pause.  Can you do me a favor, hand me that pencil?  No pause at all.  Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...' (huge pause, followed by closing credits.)

Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it, it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would like a car alarm like that.


[Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.

GEORGE: Was the alarm on?

JERRY: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.

GEORGE: I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?

JERRY: They cross the wires or something.

GEORGE: Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

(Kramer enters.)

JERRY: They stole my car.

KRAMER: Who did?

JERRY: They did.

KRAMER: Was it more than just one?

JERRY: What should I do, should I call the police?

KRAMER: What are they gonna do?

JERRY: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.

GEORGE: Maybe you should call your car phone.

JERRY: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.

JERRY: Are you serious?

GEORGE: Yeah, go ahead, call.

JERRY: I don't even know if I remember the number.

(Jerry dials.)

JERRY: What do I say if he picks up?

CAR THIEF: Hello?

JERRY: Hello? Is this 555-8383?

CAR THIEF: I have no idea.

JERRY: Can I ask you a question?

CAR THIEF: Sure.

JERRY: Did you steal my car?

CAR THIEF: Yes I did.

JERRY: You did?!

CAR THIEF: I did.

JERRY: That's my car!

CAR THIEF: I didn't know it was yours.

JERRY: What are you gonna do with it?

CAR THIEF: I dunno, drive around.

JERRY: Then can I have it back?

CAR THIEF: Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.

(Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.)

KRAMER: Hello?

CAR THIEF: Yeah, who's this?

KRAMER: Kramer.

CAR THIEF: Hello, Kramer.

KRAMER: Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.

CAR THIEF: Wait, hold on... Brown ones?

KRAMER: Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.

CAR THIEF: One-two-nine, okay.

KRAMER: Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.

JERRY: (derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?

CAR THIEF: Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?

CAR THIEF: I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.

JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

CAR THIEF: Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--

(Jerry hangs up.)

JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car.

GEORGE: Who's Sid?

JERRY: He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

JERRY: He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.

GEORGE: What, do you pay him for that?

JERRY: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.

GEORGE: How many people does he do that for?

JERRY: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.

KRAMER: He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?

GEORGE: Could anybody do that?

(Sid enters.)

JERRY: Hey Sid, what happened?

SID: I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.

JERRY: You left the keys in the car?

SID: Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.

KRAMER: You know I'm in that movie?

GEORGE: You are?

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm an extra.

GEORGE: How'd you get that?

KRAMER: Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.

GEORGE: Right out of the clear blue sky?

KRAMER: Clear blue sky!

GEORGE: Well, why didn't they ask me?

KRAMER: I got a quality.

SID: Jerry, you got insurance, right?

JERRY: Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

SID: Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.

JERRY: This Wednesday?

SID: No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.

JERRY: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.

SID: If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.

GEORGE: Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?

SID: Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.

GEORGE: Maybe I could move them until you get back.

SID: What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?

GEORGE: I'm in a transition phase right now.

SID: Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.

(Phone rings.)

JERRY: Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.


[Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.]

ELAINE: I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.

JERRY: Owen March, I never heard of him.

ELAINE: Well, he's not a baseball player.

JERRY: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.

ELAINE: Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

JERRY: What's that?

ELAINE: He's sixty-six years old.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Next please.

ELAINE: Well, go, go.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Can I help you? Name please?

JERRY: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Okay, let's see here.

JERRY: Sixty-six years old?

ELAINE: Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.

JERRY: Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?

ELAINE: What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?

JERRY: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

JERRY: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

JERRY: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: I know why we have reservations.

JERRY: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.

(The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen speaking with someone.)

JERRY: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.

ELAINE: Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?

JERRY: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.

ELAINE: Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.

(The agent returns.)

RENTAL CAR AGENT: I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.

JERRY: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: But we do have a compact if you would like that.

JERRY: Fine.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?

JERRY: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Please fill this out.

ELAINE: What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?

JERRY: Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.

ELAINE: I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.


[Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: I just don't enjoy being with him.

JERRY: Well that's what's important.

ELAINE: I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?

JERRY: How many times you been out with him?

ELAINE: Seven?

JERRY: Face to face.

ELAINE: Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?

JERRY: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.

ELAINE: Hmm... How's the pasta over there?

Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way and heads for the kitchen sink.

KRAMER: Whoa, whoa!!

JERRY: What is going on out there?

GEORGE: I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!

(George runs off into the bathroom.)

KRAMER: Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?

ELAINE: Today?!

KRAMER: You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.

ELAINE: Yeah.

KRAMER: So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.

ELAINE: He was laughing?!

KRAMER: Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.

JERRY: So then what?

KRAMER: I got a line in the movie!

ELAINE: Get out!

JERRY: That's great!

GEORGE: You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?

KRAMER: Pretty good, huh?

GEORGE: You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?

JERRY: You mean *a* career.

ELAINE: So was Mia Farrow there?

KRAMER: Uh, I didn't see him.

ELAINE: What's your line?

KRAMER: Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?

(The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.)

KRAMER: So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."

GEORGE: Is that how you're gonna say it?

KRAMER: No, no, I'm working on it.

ELAINE: Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

JERRY: No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

KRAMER: No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.

GEORGE: "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"

(Jerry pinches his nose.)

GEORGE: That was no good?

KRAMER: I didn't say anything.

ELAINE: I'm gonna go break up with Owen.

GEORGE: What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!

(George storms out.)


[Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.]

JERRY: Oh my god.

ELAINE: Call an ambulance.

JERRY: Boy, he took it hard.


[Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.]

ELAINE: We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.

JERRY: (on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.

ELAINE: Tell then to hurry! Hurry!

JERRY: (To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.

JERRY: Kramer.

KRAMER: What happened here?

ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?

JERRY: Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?

ELAINE: What extremities?

KRAMER: What's an extremity?

JERRY: You raise the feet, get blood to the head.

KRAMER: You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.

ELAINE: Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.

JERRY: I don't have a washcloth.

ELAINE: Well use a paper towel.

JERRY: You can't put a paper towel on his head.

KRAMER: What about a big sponge?

JERRY: How you gonna hold it on there?

KRAMER: Use a belt.

ELAINE: No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.

JERRY: Should we walk him around?

ELAINE and KRAMER: (at the same time) Yes, yes.

KRAMER: Yeah, I've seen them do that.

JERRY: No, no that's for a drug overdose.

KRAMER: Maybe that's what he's got.

ELAINE: No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.

KRAMER: Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.

ELAINE: He is not a drug addict!

JERRY: Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.

ELAINE: A cookie!

KRAMER: Can you give him a cookie?

ELAINE: How's he gonna chew it?

JERRY: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.

(Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.)

ELAINE: Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.

KRAMER: I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.

ELAINE: You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.

JERRY: Cookies don't liquefy.

ELAINE: Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.

KRAMER: Alright I'll get a blender.

JERRY: What blender? I don't have a blender.

KRAMER: You got a blender.

JERRY: I would know if I had a blender.

ELAINE: Where is the ambulance?!

(Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a crashing sound.)

(The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.)

JERRY: (on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.

ELAINE: I can't believe what's going on out here.

JERRY: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?

VOICE: Paramedics.

JERRY: Come on up. Okay, they're here.

ELAINE: He seems to be breathing.

JERRY: Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?

ELAINE: Almost.

JERRY: Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.

ELAINE: It's not an easy thing to bring up.

JERRY: Yeah, that's true.

ELAINE: Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.

JERRY: Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.

ELAINE: He does, how'd you know that?

JERRY: I could tell.

(Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.)

ELAINE: What happened, what took you so long?!

PARAMEDIC: We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort.

JERRY: Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!

(George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.)

GEORGE: Oh man.

JERRY: What happened to the car?

GEORGE: Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?

ELAINE: This guy I'm seeing.

GEORGE: What happened?

JERRY: We don't know!

PARAMEDIC: Who put cookies in his mouth?

JERRY and ELAINE: Cookies?

PARAMEDIC: You're not supposed to do that.

JERRY: So how'd you hit the car?

GEORGE: I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.

JERRY: It's not even my car, it's a rental.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.

GEORGE: Woody mentioned me? What did he say?

KRAMER: He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'

GEORGE: Should I apologize to Woody?

KRAMER: Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.


[Middle Monologue]

What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment. Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid. They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.'


[Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment.]

SID: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.

GEORGE: Well I know how to drive.

SID: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.

JERRY: Can I get anybody anything?

SID: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?

GEORGE: I put my pants on, Sid.

SID: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.

GEORGE: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.

SID: Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.

GEORGE: Maybe I could call my father.

(Kramer enters holding a newspaper.)

KRAMER: Hey, you seen the paper yet?

JERRY: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.

KRAMER: Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.

JERRY: (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.

KRAMER: Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.

JERRY: (continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.

SID: Oh lord.

JERRY: (finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.


[Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of pretzels.]

ELAINE: Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'

JERRY: Can he communicate?

ELAINE: Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.

JERRY: Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.

ELAINE: So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.

JERRY: What community? There's a community?

ELAINE: Of course there's a community.

JERRY: All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.

JERRY: Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident.

JERRY: That is right, somebody else was driving.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.

JERRY: Uh huh, what's that?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: You're not covered for other drivers.

JERRY: Other drivers?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Um hm.

JERRY: Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Not that particular one.

JERRY: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--

JERRY: Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.

JERRY: These pretzels are making me thirsty.


[Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup]

ELAINE: Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.


[Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.]

ELAINE: Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?

JERRY: An overdose of odor? Good question.

GEORGE: Do I smell?

ELAINE: No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.

JERRY: Ahh.

GEORGE: He's alright?

ELAINE: Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.

(The waitress brings the check.)

JERRY: Let me get that.

GEORGE: No no no, I got it.

JERRY: Please.

GEORGE: No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,

JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.

(Kramer enters and sits down.)

JERRY: What are you doing here?

KRAMER: I got fired from the movie.

GEORGE: Get out of here, why?

KRAMER: Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.

ELAINE: Aww.

KRAMER: Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.

(Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.)

JERRY: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.


[Closing monologue]

I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And the best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to get married, you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, all I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. Do you take this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. Rest of the time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the sniffles, you better be there.

JERRY: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?


[At a party]

JERRY: Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.

GEORGE: Like you do.

JERRY: Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?

GEORGE: What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?

JERRY: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?

GEORGE: Why did France give that to us anyway?

JERRY: It was a gift.

GEORGE: So countries just exchange gifts like that?

JERRY: If they like each other.

GEORGE: There's Elaine.

JERRY: See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.

GEORGE: Really? They work here in the office?

JERRY: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.

GEORGE: Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.

JERRY: You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.

GEORGE: "Off the wagon"?

JERRY: I think it's off the wagon.

GEORGE: I think it's "on the wagon".

ELAINE: Jerry, George, what are you doing here?

JERRY: What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)

ELAINE: *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)

JERRY: Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.

ELAINE: Where did you find it?

JERRY: Under the sofa cushion.

ELAINE: And you stopped by just to give it to me?

JERRY: It's your Christmas present.

ELAINE: I though I'd never find it.

GEORGE: Well today's your lucky day.

ELAINE: No. Today's *your* lucky day.

GEORGE: It will be my first one.

ELAINE: You want to work here?

GEORGE: Huh?

ELAINE: Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.

DICK: Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?

JERRY: "The guy?"

ELAINE: (softly to Dick) Dick.

GEORGE: How can you just get it?

ELAINE: My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.

JERRY: Cranberry juice?

ELAINE: And vodka.

DICK: I got the cranberry juice.

DICK: So... you're Jerry.

JERRY: So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)

MR. LIPPMAN: (What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?

GEORGE: Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.

MR. LIPPMAN: How do you read?

GEORGE: I like Mike Lubika.

MR. LIPPMAN: Mike Lubika?

GEORGE: He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...

MR. LIPPMAN: No, no, no. I mean authors.

GEORGE: Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.

MR. LIPPMAN: Name a couple.

GEORGE: Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.

MR. LIPPMAN: Art Vandelay?

GEORGE: He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.

MR. LIPPMAN: What has he written?

GEORGE: Venetian Blinds.

DICK: (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.

JERRY: Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.

ELAINE: Where's my drink?

JERRY: There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?

GEORGE: I think he was impressed.

ELAINE: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.

JERRY: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

ELAINE: Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.

JERRY: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.

ELAINE: One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.

GEORGE: Told you.


[At a clothing store]

JERRY: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.

GEORGE: Do I really have to buy her something?

JERRY: Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?

GEORGE: What is that? Is that cashmere?

JERRY: Yeah. She would love cashmere.

GEORGE: Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.

JERRY: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.

GEORGE: Wow. Excuse me, Miss?

SALES WOMAN: Yes?

GEORGE: How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?

SALES WOMAN: (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.

GEORGE: What? I don't see anything.

SALES WOMAN: See this red dot?

GEORGE: Oh yeah.

JERRY: Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)

GEORGE: (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?

SALES WOMAN: There's no exchanges on this.

GEORGE: You think she would care about the red dot?

JERRY: It's hard to say.

GEORGE: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?

JERRY: Well I can see it.

GEORGE: Yeah, but you know where it is.

JERRY: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?

GEORGE: Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?

JERRY: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.

GEORGE: Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?

JERRY: You want me to take an overview?

GEORGE: Please.

JERRY: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Yeah so?

ELAINE: He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.

JERRY: Oh boy, can you smell it?

ELAINE: No. I can't smell it.

JERRY: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.

ELAINE: You don't always smell someone from a drink.

JERRY: Yes you do.

ELAINE: What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?

JERRY: Yes you would.

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?

KRAMER: Okay.

JERRY: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?

KRAMER: You can smell me without the drink.

ELAINE: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.

KRAMER: Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?

JERRY: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.

(Kramer drinks.)

KRAMER: All right.

(Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.)

JERRY: I don't smell anything.

ELAINE: Maybe we're too close to the bottle.

(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: (over the speaker) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.

GEORGE: Hello everybody.

KRAMER: Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.

GEORGE: (uncomfortablly) Thank you.

ELAINE: Hey what's that?

GEORGE: It's an early Christmas present.

ELAINE: Christmas present? For who?

GEORGE: For you.

ELAINE: *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.

KRAMER: Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...

JERRY: Kramer. Yeah that'll do.

ELAINE: (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?

GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.

ELAINE: Oh, I love cashmere.

GEORGE: Well who doesn't.

ELAINE: My, George this must have cost a fortune.

GEORGE: Ahh, money.

ELAINE: Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?

JERRY: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.

ELAINE: George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.

GEORGE: Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.

KRAMER: What's that red dot on your sweater?

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.

ELAINE: Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.

GEORGE: What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?

JERRY: (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.

ELAINE: What don't you know?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: Well do you see it or don't you?

JERRY: Ahem. Say that again?

ELAINE: Do you see it or don't you?

JERRY: Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.

(Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.)

JERRY: Now what did you ask me again.

(Kramer is snoring.)


[At the office. Elaine is walking by]

ELAINE: You're still here. You're a dynamo.

GEORGE: I can't believe I get paid for this.

ELAINE: I'll see you tomorrow.

(Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.)

GEORGE: How you doing?

CLEANING WOMAN: Hello.

(The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning.)


[At Monk's]

JERRY: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?

GEORGE: Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.

JERRY: Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.

GEORGE: Why is that?

JERRY: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.

GEORGE: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)

JERRY: Convulsing?

GEORGE: Convulsing?

JERRY: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.

GEORGE: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.

JERRY: You don't drink.

GEORGE: I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.

JERRY: So you started drinking.

GEORGE: So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.

JERRY: So how was it?

GEORGE: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.

JERRY: Good thing the cleaning lady was there.


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: Dick was fired.

JERRY: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.

ELAINE: You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?

JERRY: What are you saying?

ELAINE: I'm not saying anything.

JERRY: You're saying something.

ELAINE: What could I be saying?

JERRY: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.

ELAINE: If I was saying something I would have said it.

JERRY: Well why don't you say it?

ELAINE: I said it.

JERRY: What did you say?

ELAINE: Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.

(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: (over the speaker) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.

JERRY: No I didn't.

ELAINE: Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.

JERRY: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.

ELAINE: How much did he save?

JERRY: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.

(Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.)

GEORGE: I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.

JERRY: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.

GEORGE: Did you tell her anything?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Do you swear?

JERRY: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.

GEORGE: Oh you told her didn't you.

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?

GEORGE: What? Did I what?

ELAINE: You did didn't you.

GEORGE: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.

ELAINE: Well Jerry told me that you did.

GEORGE: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.

JERRY: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.

GEORGE: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.


[At the office.]

GEORGE: This is for you.

CLEANING WOMAN: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.

GEORGE: As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.

CLEANING WOMAN: Okay, okay, can I open it now?

GEORGE: Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.

CLEANING WOMAN: Oh! Is that cashmere?

GEORGE: Of course it's cashemere.

CLEANING WOMAN: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!

GEORGE: Just a little something for Christmas.

CLEANING WOMAN: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, "what do you call this most beautiful fabric?", and he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked if I could have it, and he said "No. Get away from me." Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.

GEORGE: I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.

CLEANING WOMAN: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.

GEORGE: Take it off. You're going to ruin it.

CLEANING WOMAN: (noticing the dot) What's this?


[At the comedy club]

JERRY: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.

DICK: The only stench is comming from you.

AUDIENCE: Oooooh.

JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.

DICK: It's off the wagon.

JERRY: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?

DICK: I don't know.

JERRY: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?

DICK: You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.

JERRY: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?

DICK: What the hell do you know about wagons?

JERRY: I know enough not to get on them.


[In the Lippman's office.]

MR. LIPPMAN: I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?

GEORGE: Who said that?

MR. LIPPMAN: She did.

GEORGE: Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.

MR. LIPPMAN: You're fired.

GEORGE: Well you didn't have to say it like that.

MR. LIPPMAN: I want you out of here by the end of the day.

GEORGE: What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?

MR. LIPPMAN: Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.

(He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office "wearing" it. )


[In the hall of the office]

ELAINE: You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.

GEORGE: You never had sex in the office before?

ELAINE: No. I once made out with someone but that was it.

GEORGE: Alright so you made out with someone.

ELAINE: Well that's not sex.

GEORGE: Kissing is sex.

ELAINE: Kissing is not sex.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Jerry.

ELAINE: Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Over here.

ELAINE: What are you doing here?

JERRY: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.

ELAINE: Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?

JERRY: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.

ELAINE: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

JERRY: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.

*crash*

DICK: Merry Christmas.

ELAINE: Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.

GEORGE: Hide, hide under the desk.

ELAINE: Ow, ow move over.

JERRY: Get off of me.

ELAINE: I've got no room.

(Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.)

DICK: Is that cashmere?

GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.

DICK: (noticing the dot) What's this?


[At the comedy club]

JERRY: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.

DICK: You mean on the wagon.

JERRY: Don't get smart.

[Monk's Café, the whole gang at a booth]

KRAMER: All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.

ELAINE: Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?

KRAMER: Well, yeah...

ELAINE: Ok, what time is your job interview George?

GEORGE: 9:45

JERRY: Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.

GEORGE: What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.

ELAINE: All right, I'm gonna go.

JERRY: What time is the lesbian wedding?

ELAINE: 9:30

GEORGE: Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?

ELAINE: Yeah, they flip a coin.

GEORGE: What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.

JERRY: I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)

GEORGE: I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: "That's why I'm not heterosexual".

KRAMER: Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.

JERRY: Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.


[On the Subway]

GEORGE: How many tickets are you paying today?

KRAMER: Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)

GEORGE: No doors?

KRAMER: I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.

(Blind violinist comes playing, with mug for the money. Everybody else gives him some change, except George)

GEORGE: I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.

VIOLIN PLAYER: Thank you.

GEORGE: That guy is not blind.

JERRY: So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?

GEORGE: I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.

JERRY: Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.

GEORGE: That's amazing.

JERRY: So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.

GEORGE: What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.

JERRY: All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?

ELAINE: I can't. I'm the best man.

JERRY: Kramer, bumper-cars?

KRAMER: I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?

JERRY: Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.

SUBWAY ANNOUNCEMENT: 42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train.

(They all get off and go to different directions.)

ELAINE: See'ya.


[Multiple Subway Train Intro Scenes]

(Jerry comes in and sits down. A fat man across from him gives a look.)

(George gets on another subway train. Sits next to a beautiful woman. They smile to another.)

(Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. Stumbles around as all seats get filled right before him. He squeezes himself into a seat with a young obese man.)

(Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves and Jerry falls in his seat.)


[George's Train]

(Woman next to George rubs her leg and George looks at her)

WOMAN: You looking for a job?

GEORGE: Me, why?

WOMAN: Well, you're reading the classifieds.

GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.

WOMAN: You didn't look like someone who needed a job.

GEORGE: Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.

WOMAN: So, you're in 'the market'?

GEORGE: Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.

WOMAN: Which market?

GEORGE: Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.

WOMAN: So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?

GEORGE: They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.

WOMAN: Really?

GEORGE: Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.

(Train horn blows and George looks back)


[Elaine's Train]

(She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman approaches her)

WOMAN: I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.

ELAINE: It's ironic.

Women: What's ironic?

ELAINE: This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.

WOMAN: No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?

ELAINE: Oh...

WOMAN: Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?

ELAINE: A wedding.

Women: A wedding?

ELAINE: Yeah

WOMAN: Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.

ELAINE: You're telling me.

WOMAN: So, are they a nice couple?

ELAINE: Oh, very nice.

WOMAN: What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?

ELAINE: She.

Women: She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.

ELAINE: There is no he.

Women: There is no he. So, who's getting married?

ELAINE: Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.

Women: Lesbian wedding.

ELAINE: Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.

Women (talks to man next to her): My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)

ELAINE: No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!


[Kramer's train]

(A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat. Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the paper. The other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece of one page.)


[Jerry's train]

(He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to the floor. Man across gives him a look.)


[Elaine's train

(Train is full packed)

ELAINE'S VOICE: I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.

(Train suddenly stops)

ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh, man. We're stopping?


[George's train]

WOMAN: Well, this is where I get off.

GEORGE: Oh, you do?

WOMAN: Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.

GEORGE: No, no, what, what?

WOMAN: Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.

GEORGE: Yeah, well....

WOMAN: Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.

(George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs after her)

GEORGE: Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.

(He gets stuck between closing doors)

GEORGE: I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!


[Kramer's Train]

(Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking)

MAN1: This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick.

MAN2: How do you know it's going to win?

MAN1: My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers. Every horse he has ever given me has won. See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his maiden. It's going to go to great price, maybe 30:1. I'm telling you, it's a lock.

MAN2: But it rained last night.

MAN1: Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'.

MAN2: His mudda' was a mudda'?

MAN1: What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to call my bookie. (looks around to see if anyone is listening) Hey, don't tell anybody.

(Kramer quickly turns away)


[Jerry's Train]

(Jerry wakes up and looks to guy opposite to him. The fat guy is naked and reading a paper.)

JERRY: O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?

NAKED MAN: Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.

JERRY: You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.

NAKED MAN: You got something against naked body?

JERRY: I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?

NAKED MAN: Who's got time for squat thrusts?

JERRY: All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.

NAKED MAN: I like a good breakfast.

JERRY: I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.

NAKED MAN: I'm not ashamed of my body.

JERRY: That's your problem, you should be.

(Naked man drops half of his newspaper)

JERRY: Don't get up, please, allow me.

(Jerry picks up the paper)


[Elaine's Train]

(Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train.)

ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!

(Lights in the train go off)


[George and the woman step in to a hotel room]

GEORGE: Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.

WOMAN: Make your-self comfortable.

(She steps in to bathroom.)

GEORGE'S VOICE: Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.

(She comes out from the bathroom, wearing a nightie.)

GEORGE: Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.


[Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. He is talking with a guy behind in the line.]

KRAMER: Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.

GUY: The bug boy.

KRAMER: Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.

GUY: Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night.

KRAMER: Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.

GUY: His father was a mudda'?

KRAMER: His mudda' was a mudda'.

GUY: His mudda' was a mudda'?

KRAMER: What did I just say?

(Kramer gets to the cashier)

KRAMER: Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.


[Jerry's train]

NAKED MAN: They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.

JERRY: I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.

NAKED MAN: No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence.

JERRY: Defence? Please. ...They need speed.

NAKED MAN: Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen.

JERRY: Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.

NAKED MAN: They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office.

JERRY: But you gotta like their chances.

NAKED MAN: I LUV their chances.

JERRY: Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.

NAKED MAN: It's a deal!


[Elaine is in a stopped train with no lights]

ELAINE'S VOICE: Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!


[George and the beautiful woman are still in the hotel room. The woman is putting handcuffs on George and the other end to the backboard of the bed]

GEORGE: Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.

WOMAN: Oh, don't worry. I do.

(She steps in to the bathroom)

GEORGE: You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.

WOMAN: Like what?

GEORGE: Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"

(She comes out of the bathroom fully clothed)

GEORGE: What's going on?

WOMAN: It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.

GEORGE: Get going? But we haven't really, you know....

WOMAN: Eight dollars? Eight dollars?

GEORGE: What are you doing? You're robbing me?

WOMAN: I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?

GEORGE: Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?

WOMAN: I'm taking your clothes.

GEORGE: No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.

WOMAN: Bye George.

GEORGE: No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?


[Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office]

(The race is on and Pappanick is slowly making ground. Kramer is pounding himself imitating the jockey and shouts: Yes, yes, yes... The winner is Pappanick)

KRAMER: Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)

(Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money around. There is a big thug looking at the money. Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. He makes a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and so does the thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes. The naked man has put his clothes back on and he and Jerry are getting of the train.)

NAKED MAN: I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.

JERRY: First we ride the cyclone.

NAKED MAN: Chilly out.

(Jerry takes a deep breath)

JERRY: Aah, French fries.


[Kramer is running away from the thug and enters the train where the blind violinist is playing. Kramer knocks down the violin player and the thug picks Kramer up and looks for the money.]

THUG: Give me the money. Give me the money!

BLIND VIOLIN PLAYER: (puts a gun to the thug's head) Freeze, Police!


[Back to the Monk's café. Jerry, Kramer and Elaine are sitting in a booth]

JERRY: No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.

ELAINE: Too bad.

JERRY: You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!

(Waves around a stuffed monkey)

JERRY: You want him?

ELAINE: Get that out of my face.

JERRY: So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!

(George enters wearing a sheet)

MAN AT THE COUNTER: (yelling) Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna!

GEORGE: How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?

ELAINE: George?

JERRY: Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?

GEORGE: You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?

JERRY: Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.

GEORGE: Give me your key, I gotta get it.

KRAMER: What happened?

GEORGE: Never mind what happened, just give me the key.

JERRY: Come on, I'll go with you.

ELAINE: Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait...

(Kramer gets the check, looks at it and gets pile of cash and pays. Jerry and Elaine look amazed)

[Jerry's Apartment]

GEORGE: ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!

GEORGE: We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?

(Jerry enters)

JERRY: Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.

GEORGE: I was telling you about Noel.

JERRY: Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...

GEORGE: [sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...

JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. What about her?

GEORGE: What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?

JERRY: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.

GEORGE: No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...

GEORGE: How do I get the hand?

JERRY: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.

GEORGE: She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...

JERRY: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...

GEORGE: Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!

GEORGE: With all due respect, I don't think so...

JERRY: That smells good, what is that?

KRAMER: The *beach*!

JERRY: The *beach*?

GEORGE: What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!

KRAMER: I just joined the Polar Bear Club.

JERRY: You joined the *Polar Bears*?!

GEORGE: What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?

KRAMER: Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....

JERRY: Yeah... So's shock therapy.

JERRY: [with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!

KRAMER: Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.

GEORGE: Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

JERRY: You don't know?

GEORGE: No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...

JERRY: You think they have fleas there, don't you?

GEORGE: *No*...

JERRY: Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.

GEORGE: All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...

ELAINE: I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?

JERRY: They have a piano backstage they warm up on.

ELAINE: *No*, we would have heard it.

JERRY: What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?

GEORGE: I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.

JERRY: [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!

(A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.)

JERRY: Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)

(Noel begins. Dramatically. It's enough to make a man reach for his candy pooper. Jerry helps himself to a Pez, he stands Tweety up on Elaine's purse on her lap. Elaine valiantly tries to hold back her laughter, but it escalates from a giggle to a chortle to a chuckle to laughter to snorting. Noel is visibly shaken and she has difficulty playing with this anonymous distraction from one of the unwashed masses. Elaine removes herself from the auditorium, all the while snorting and gasping for breath, (we're talkin' full-on gales of laughter, here). Outside, she runs into an old acquaintance.)

STEVE: Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.

ELAINE: Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...

STEVE: What're you doing down here?

ELAINE: Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.

MOLLIKA: Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.

ELAINE: We did. We're just hanging out.

MOLLIKA: REally. ... You really look great.

ELAINE: Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?

MOLLIKA: Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.

ELAINE: Have you thought about an intervention?

MOLLIKA: What's that?

ELAINE: You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.

MOLLIKA: He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.

(Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.)


[Outside Noel's dressing room]

ElainELAINE: I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!

GEORGE: What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?

JERRY: I dunno, it was an impulse.

GEORGE: What kind of a sick impulse does that??

JERRY: How could I know she would start to laugh?

ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!

JERRY: Can we just go in already?

GEORGE: What are we gonna tell her?

ELAINE: I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.

GEORGE: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...

ELAINE: [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.

JERRY: What about?

GEORGE: Hey, hey! We're discussing something!

JERRY: I know, but I'm distracted now.

GEORGE: What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.

ELAINE: When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.

JERRY: Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?

ELAINE: He's good.

GEORGE: Uh, can we cut to the chase?

JERRY: "Cut to the chase"?

GEORGE: Yeah...

JERRY: What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?

GEORGE: A lot of people say it.

JERRY: I would lose that.

GEORGE: [Accusingly] What's *that*?

JERRY: "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!

GEORGE: [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.

ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.

JERRY: Really, an intervention ...

GEORGE: Y'know people, we got a situation over here!

ELAINE: Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.

JERRY: Me? Why me?

ELAINE: 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.

JERRY: Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...

GEORGE: All right, OK, I'm goin' in.

JERRY: We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)

ELAINE: All right.

(They Enter)

GEORGE: Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.

NOEL: No..

GEORGE: Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel

JERRY: You play a *Hell* of a piano.

ELAINE: Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.

NOEL: Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...

ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.

NOEL: Well then, what was she laughing at?

JERRY: Pez?

NOEL: Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?

GEORGE: Me, uh, uh, no, ...

JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.

ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.

JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.

NOEL: I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]

ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.

GEORGE: If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)

[Noel enters]

GEORGE: All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.

NOEL: I don't feel like it tonight.

JERRY: We'll be outside

ELAINE: Yeah

JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?

NOEL: I just crack my knuckles.

GEORGE: We'll have a good time

NOEL: I don't feel like it

GEORGE: Ah, come on

NOEL: I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!

GEORGE: Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]


[MONKS]

JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.

ELAINE: What? How?

JERRY: A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.

ELAINE: So? What happened?

JERRY: What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.

ELAINE: Shut up!

JERRY: All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.

ELAINE: Whar about Kramer?

JERRY: He's the same!


[Jerry on phone at home]

JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?

KRAMER: (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.

KRAMER: Can I get in on that?

JERRY: What do you think? It's like a poker game?

KRAMER: Is Elaine going?

JERRY: Yeah

KRAMER: Well, I knew him as well as she did.

JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her.

KRAMER: So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?

JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.

(Buzzer)

GEORGE: It's George

JERRY: Stop smelling your arm.

KRAMER: You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach

JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."

KRAMER: Tell me about it!

JERRY: Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Well it's over. It's definitely over.

JERRY: She broke up with you?

GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.

JERRY: What was on the list?

GEORGE: Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,

JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,

GEORGE: Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.

JERRY: What's wrong with lunch?

GEORGE: Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.

KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?

GEORGE: I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.

KRAMER: Break up with her

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.

JERRY: A preemptive breakup.

GEORGE: A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.


[MONKS]

GEORGE: So, I am have to going to break up with you.

NOEL: You're breaking up with me?

GEORGE: I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.

NOEL: Wow.

GEORGE: Shocked?

NOEL: I really am.

GEORGE: Never expected this did you?

NOEL: I thought everything was fine.

GEORGE: Well, live and learn.

NOEL: I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?

GEORGE: Kind of.

NOEL: I'm very confused.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.

NOEL: I thought,...

GEORGE: Now, stop it ...

NOEL: What do you want, I can make you happy.

GEORGE: When you're playing the piano do you think about me?

NOEL: I don't know.

GEORGE: This is what I'm talking about.

NOEL: OK, I'll think about you.

GEORGE: All the time.

NOEL: All the time? ... OK, All the time.

GEORGE: I can't hear you.

NOEL: All the time. ALL THE TIME.

GEORGE: See, It's not so hard.


[CALVIN KLEIN]

KRAMER: Go ahead smell, smell

STEVE: Yeah, so?

KRAMER: Do you recognize it? ... The beach.

STEVE: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm talking about the beach.

STEVE: What about it?

KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.

STEVE: That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.

KRAMER: Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?

STEVE: Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.

KRAMER: So you don't think it's a good idea?


[The Intervention [NOTE:DOUBLE CHECK THIS PART FOR SURE!!!!]

(To Elaine)

GUY: The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there

ELAINE: (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?

GUY: Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.

(To Jerry)

OTHER GUY: Are there any ice cubes?

JERRY: In the freezer.

OTHER GUY: I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.

JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.

OTHER GUY: I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)

GUY: Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?

STEVE: What's the plan?

JERRY: Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.

OTHER GUY: Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.

GUY: No, we all have to talk.

ELAINE: What's the order?

GUY: We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.

ROBERTA: Why am I first?

ELAINE: Albano is your last name.

ROBERTA: That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.

STEVE: I'll go first.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Is this the interference?

JERRY: Intervention.

OTHER GUY: What are you doing here?

KRAMER: Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?

STEVE: Hey, this is for close friends only.

KRAMER: I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?

OTHER GUY: Let him stay.

KRAMER: Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.

STEVE: Somebody's going to make that crap?

(Some old guys enter)

OLD GUY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.

OTHER GUY: They can't stay.

OLD GUY: We're having a party here?

JERRY: No, we're having an intervention

OLD GUY: An intervention? Who's intervening?

JERRY: There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.

OLD GUY: Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, "What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?"

(Buzzer)

GUY: It's him.

ROBERTA: What should we do?

ELAINE: Hide!

JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)

GEORGE: It's George

JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.

GUY: If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.

ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.

GUY: Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?

ELAINE: You're getting warm.

(George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful)

GEORGE: We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.

JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.

GEORGE: Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?

JERRY: Well, uh..

NOEL: (happily) Elaine, hi.

ELAINE: Oh, hi Noel

(Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them)

JERRY: Well, you're looking well.

GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.

STEVE: Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

GEORGE: (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!

STEVE: You think so?

GEORGE: I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you

OLD MAN: The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.

ELAINE: (Chuckles)

Old GUY; at least give me a pocket.

ELAINE: (laughs)

(Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven)

NOEL: That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.

ELAINE: No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.

(Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg)

NOEL: You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.

JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.

NOEL: You lied to me George, you lied to me.

GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?

NOEL: I ... am breaking up ... with you!

GEORGE: You can't break up with me. I've got hand.

NOEL: And you're going to need it.

(Noel exits, George chases her)

(Richie and John enter)

JERRY: Hey Richie

RICHIE: So what's going on?

(Later)

JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.

GEORGE: I can't do these puzzles.

JERRY: So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table

GEORGE: Ah ah Pez dispenser.

JERRY: He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them

GEORGE: Well they're hard to load.

JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.

GEORGE: Poor kid.

JERRY: So as he's telling the story he starts crying.

GEORGE: What did you do?

JERRY: What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.

GEORGE: Wow

JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.

GEORGE: What's a three letter word for candy?

JERRY: I can't do those things.

The thing I don’t understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don’t die and that’s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don’t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it’s worse because now they’ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that’s why these people don’t succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don’t work, try a rope. Car won’t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There’s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.



[Jerry’s Apartment]

JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?

ELAINE: Na.

JERRY: What are you doing? We’re going out for dinner in ten minutes.

ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: It’s George.

JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You’ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?

ELAINE: I don’t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?

JERRY: I think I’ll take out the garbage.

ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?

JERRY: Well, once I didn’t have dinner until, like 9:00 o’clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage – meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya’? Throw out my garbage for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Come on, it’s just down the hall.

GEORGE: Give me two bucks. I’ll do it for two bucks.

JERRY: I’ll give you 50 cents.

GEORGE: There’s no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.

JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake’s coffee cake

GEORGE: You’re not getting no Drake’s Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I’m all set. I got the ticket. I’m going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.

JERRY: I don’t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?

GEORGE: It’s an incredible deal. I don’t know why you don’t come with me.

JERRY: Nah, I don’t go for these non-refundable deals. I can’t commit to a woman. I’m not going to commit to an airline.

(Gina enters the hall)

GINA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

GINA: How are you?

JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake’s Coffee Cake is?

GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.

JERRY: How much do they cost?

GINA: The junior?

GEORGE: No, no the full size.

JERRY: No, no the junior.

GEORGE: You didn’t say "junior".

GINA: I haven’t had one of those since I was a little girl.

JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya’ doing?

MARTIN: Good enough.

(MARTIN leaves with Gina)

JERRY: Boy she’s sexy isn’t she?

(Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer’s apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry’s apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)

JERRY: Do you believe that guy?

ELAINE: What guy?

JERRY: My neighbour:

ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?

JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?

GEORGE: He didn’t seem too pleased.

ELAINE: Maybe I’ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.

GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.

JERRY: What’s so amazing? You’ve seen him before.

GEORGE: I haven’t seen him for months.

JERRY: What was the dream?

GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.

JERRY: I think I’ve played there.

GEORGE: I’ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.

JERRY: You’re a little paranormal

ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.

GEORGE: I’d love to go. Make an appointment.

JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?

GEORGE: I just got fired.

JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.

ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.

JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.

(They exit)



[Jerry’s apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]

JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?

GINA: It’s Gina.

JERRY: Who?

GINA: Martine’s girl friend.

JERRY: Martine?

GINA: You next door neighbour.

JERRY: Oh, Martin!

(Jerry opens door)

GEORGE: It’s Martine. I think he’s dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.

JERRY: What?

GINA: Come on.

JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.

GINA: We don’t have enough time.

JERRY: It’ll take two seconds.

GINA: There is no time.

JERRY: We don’t have two seconds?

GINA: All right. Go ahead.

JERRY: Nah, forget it.

GINA: No, go ahead.

JERRY: Nah. I’ll just wear the pajamas.

GINA: Will you just get it.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GINA: Forget it. Come on.

JERRY: Nah, I’ll go get the robe.



[Metropolitan Hospital Center]

JERRY: That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.

GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.

JERRY: Really? It’s over?

GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man’s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.

JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?

GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake’s Coffee Cake.

JERRY: He said that?

GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How it’s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.

JERRY: I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.

GINA: I wasn’t.

JERRY: You weren’t?

GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?

JERRY: Of course.

GINA: Tell me everything.

JERRY: Are you sure he can’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.

GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.

JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.

GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.

JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.

GINA: Are you afraid of him?

JERRY: No.

GINA: Then kiss me.

JERRY: Here?

GINA: Yes, right here.

JERRY: Is this the proper venue?

GINA: You don’t want to?

JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.

GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.

JERRY: I can’t. What if he wakes up?

GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and you’re afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?

JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.



[Jerry’s apartment]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?

JERRY: Yeah, I heard.

KRAMER: I can’t believe he’s in a coma.

KRAMER: He’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?

JERRY: Who told you about Martin?

KRAMER: Newman! He’s good friends with him.

JERR: Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.

KRAMER: He’s got all of my attachments, you know.

JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?

KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?

JERRY: You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? They can’t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?

KRAMER: So what’s going on between you and Gina?

JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.

KRAMER: Uh, uh.

JERRY: So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.

KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see that’s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?

JERRY: Nothing.

KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?

JERRY: I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.

KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see that’s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn’t matter what you do around it.

JERRY: So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.

KRAMER: I’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can’t get out of it in 24 hours, it’s a land rush.

JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?

KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! That’s why I’m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody’s going to grab it.



[The psychic’s apartment]

RULA: Martin’s spirit came to you as a warning.

ELAINE: Why would he come to George?

RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.

GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.

RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?

GEORGE: Drakes?

RULA: Yes.

GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?

RULA: No, why?

GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drake’s Coffee Cake.

RULA: Maybe I did.

ELAINE: Take it away.

GEORGE: She hasn’t eaten in two days.

RULA: Who’s Pauline?

GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.

RULA: Do you think about her?

GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.

RULA: Cut these with your left hand.

GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.

RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?

RULA: Not in this life.

ELAINE: Should you be smoking?

RULA: Does it bother you?

ELAINE: You’re pregnant.

GEORGE: Elaine.

RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.

RULA: Ah oh.

GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?

RULA: I don’t know about this trip George.

GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?

ELAINE: It’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.

GEORGE: Elaine, she’s a psychic. She knows how the kid’s going to be.

GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?

RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.

ELAINE: Now listen. I just don’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.

GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?

ELAINE: It’s disgusting.

RULA: I DON’T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.

ELAINE: Oh fine, I don’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.

RULA: Get the hell out.

(Elaine leaving)

GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.

GEORGE: If you don’t say anything I will assume it’s a plane crash.

RULA: Get out.

GEORGE: Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?



[Jerry’s apartment]

GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.

JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.

GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.

GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?

JERRY: They’re a comedy team.

GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.

JERRY: Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.

GINA: You will show me The Stooges?

JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.

GINA: When?

JERRY: Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.

GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.

JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.

GINA: You’re still afraid. You are not a man.

JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?

GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?

JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.

(Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman)

KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.

NEWMAN: I can’t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.

KRAMER: ???

NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Hello Newman.



[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]

JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.

GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn’t hurt me.

ELAINE: (jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?

JERRY: Boy, it’s a good thing we came.

GEORGE: Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there’s native unrest.

ELAINE: Hi, I haven’t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.

NURSE: We’ll call you.

JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If I’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.

GEORGE: How come?

JERRY: Looters.

ELAINE: How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?

JERRY: She’s really hungry.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: Kramer

KRAMER: Well, Newman’s upstairs visiting Martin.

GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?

KRAMER: You’re not going?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Why not?

GEORGE: The psychic said something terrible will happen.

KRAMER: I dig.



[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martin’s room]

KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she’s going to kill me.

NEWMAN: He can’t hear you, you idiot. Why don’t you just buy another one.

KRAMER: Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?

NEWMAN: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.

KRAMER: I don’t want a carpet sweeper. They don’t do anything.

NEWMAN: It gets my rug clean.

KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.

NEWMAN: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.

KRAMER: I wouldn’t set foot in your house.

(Jerry enters)

JERRY: Hello.

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: How’s he doing?

KRAMER: He looks happy to me.

NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.

JERRY: Why wouldn’t he?

NEWMAN: No reason.

JERRY: He’ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.

NEWMAN: I’ll bring him up to date.

JERRY: How up to date?

NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.

JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?

NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.

KRAMER: Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He’s not going.

NEWMAN: I don’t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..

JERRY: Drake’s Coffee Cake

NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?

JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.

NEWMAN: Boy, that’s the full size.

JERRY: That’s your big boy.

NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?

JERRY: I don’t give out bites. I got another one. But I’m saving it for later.

NEWMAN: Just one bite?

JERRY: I don’t think so. You know they, they’re so fragile.

NEWMAN: All right! All right. I won’t say anything.

JERRY: You swear?

NEWMAN: I swear.

JERRY: On your mother’s life?

NEWMAN: On my mother’s life.

KRAMER: oh oh oh oh oh

NEWMAN: Oooh,



[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]

ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.

(George sees the Psychic’s girl, Faisy and follows her into the Psychic’s room))

GEORGE: …sweetheart, no come here, … sweetheart

RULA: pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)

GEORGE: how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.

RULA: The nurse said she would be right back. They’re supposed to take me into the delivery room.

GEORGE: Oh, that’s great. That’s great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don’t even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn’t get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..

RULA: Oh, where’s the nurse

GEORGE: I don’t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don’t you get a nurse for mommy? … Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.

RULA: Don’t take that trip.

GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?

RULA: (screams) EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.

(Doctor enters)

Dx: All right, Rula, it’s time to go.

GEORGE: Because? Because?

(Elaine enters Martins room)

ELAINE: Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! … Drake’s Coffee Cake? … Give me that.

NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or I’ll tell.

JERRY: Elaine! No! No!

MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,

(In hallway as they wheel Rula to give birth)

GEORGE: Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

(Martin’s room – Martin grabbing Jerry – Elaine eating the Drake’s Coffee Cake)

NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.

KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!

JERRY: Hey!

NEWMAN: It was disgusting.



[Jerry’s apartment]

JERRY: What are you doing? We’re going out to dinner in ten minutes.

GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. It’s really quite disgusting.

JERRY: What did she name the kid?

GEORGE: You wouldn’t believe it. Rasputin.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Heey!

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: when did you get back?

KRAMER: A couple of hours ago.

GEORGE: So how was it?

KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.

JERRY: osh.

KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.

JERRY: Woah. (hitting George)

KRAMER: Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.

JERRY: Wow! (hitting George)

KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson

JERRY: Oh! (hitting George)

KRAMER: We played Backgammon in the nude.

JERRY: Oh! (hitting George)

KRAMER: She’s a sweet kid.

JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!

KRAMER: Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That’s probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.

GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta’ watch for the jellyfish.

KRAMER: Yeah.

KRAMER: What’s this?

JERRY: Oh, it’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.

KRAMER: They moved in together?

JERRY: Yeah, it’s some place down in the village.

KRAMER: Phew.

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: It’s Elaine.

JERRY: All right we’re coming down.

KRAMER: Hey, where ya’ going?

JERRY: We’re taking Elaine to dinner. She’s got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?

KRAMER: Um, I’d like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we’ll be getting together.

GEORGE: Elle McPherson going to be there?

KRAMER: OH! I got to call her back.

(Kramer exits)

Well have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time and a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now you are playing God. Of course God was the first person to fix people up. Fixed up Adam and Eve. Ya know I'm sure he said to Adam, "No she's nice ah..she's a..she's a.. yeah she's very free about here body doesn't really wear much and ah she was going out with a snake. I think that's over though."


[Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.]

GEORGE: Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.

JERRY: Oh, yes you will.

GEORGE: No, I won't.

JERRY: Yeah, maybe you won't.

GEORGE: I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.

JERRY: Are my nostrils getting bigger?

GEORGE: No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm

George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?

(Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi' which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)


[Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.]

CYNTHIA: There's just no men out there, you know?

ELAINE: I know.

CYNTHIA: I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.

ELAINE: I hate the good ones.

CYNTHIA: Is Jerry one of the good ones?

ELAINE: That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.

CYNTHIA: Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're right."

ELAINE: You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.

CYNTHIA: No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.


[Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.]

GEORGE: I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.

JERRY: Oh, so there's still hope.

GEORGE: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.

JERRY: Oh, so hopelessness is the key.

GEORGE: It's my only hope.


[Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.]

CYNTHIA: See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.

ELAINE: Well, at least you're not bitter.

CYNTHIA: Who says I'm not bitter?

ELAINE: Aren't you too young to be bitter?

CYNTHIA: No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.

ELAINE: Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.

CYNTHIA: Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.


[Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.

ELAINE: So what'd you do last night?

JERRY: Went out with George, you?

ELAINE: Went out with Cynthia.

JERRY: How was it? What'd you talk about?

ELAINE: Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?

JERRY: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.

ELAINE: I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.

JERRY: George too.

(They look at each other for a moment.)

JERRY AND ELAINE (together): Yeah, right.

JERRY: I've never fixed anybody up.

ELAINE: Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.

JERRY: Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?

ELAINE: I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?

JERRY: Well you implied it.

ELAINE: I didn't say it.

JERRY: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?

ELAINE: Who is he?

JERRY: He's George!

ELAINE: She's Cynthia!

JERRY: So what?

ELAINE: What, you don't think she's beautiful?

JERRY: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?

ELAINE: You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.

JERRY: I went out with you.

ELAINE: That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.

JERRY: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.

ELAINE: He can really do that?

JERRY: Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.

ELAINE: What, are you into this?

JERRY: Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

ELAINE: No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?

JERRY: Naturally.

ELAINE: Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?

JERRY: Everything.

ELAINE: What if it worked out?

JERRY (dialing): Yeah right.


[Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.]

GEORGE: Out of the question. Out of the question!

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?

JERRY: She's good looking.

GEORGE: How good looking?

JERRY: Very good looking.

GEORGE: Really good looking?

JERRY: Really very good looking.

GEORGE: Would you take her out?

JERRY: Yes, I would take her out.

GEORGE: Oh, you hesitated.

JERRY: What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!

GEORGE: No, something's off here, you hesitated.

JERRY: I'm telling you, she's good looking.

GEORGE: What about the body, what kind of body?

JERRY: Good body, nice body.

GEORGE: How nice?

JERRY: Nice.

GEORGE: Just nice?

JERRY: Pretty nice.

GEORGE: Really good?

JERRY: Really very nice and good.

GEORGE: What about personality?

JERRY: Good personality. Funny. Bright.

GEORGE: Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.

JERRY: How could she be smarter than you?

GEORGE: Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?


[Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.]

CYNTHIA: First of all, what does he do?

ELAINE: He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-

CYNTHIA: He's not working?! How come he's not working?

ELAINE: Well, um, he, he got fired.

CYNTHIA: Why did he get fired?

ELAINE: Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.

CYNTHIA: Excuse me?

ELAINE: Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.

CYNTHIA: Is he nuts?

ELAINE: No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.

CYNTHIA: What does he look like?

ELAINE: Pardon?

CYNTHIA: What does he look like?

ELAINE: Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.

CYNTHIA: Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?

ELAINE: Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.

CYNTHIA: He's bald?

ELAINE: No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.

CYNTHIA: So he will be bald.

ELAINE: Yup.


[Cut back to Jerry and George.]

GEORGE: What kind of hair?

JERRY: You know, long dark hair.

GEORGE: Flowing?

JERRY: Flowing?

GEORGE: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.

JERRY: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?

GEORGE: Yeah, that's right.

JERRY: Just clarifying.

GEORGE: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?

JERRY: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?

GEORGE: I'd like to be able to get it out.

JERRY: I think you'll get it out.

GEORGE: What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.

JERRY: She's got a fine cheek.

GEORGE: Is there a pinkish hue?

JERRY: A pinkish hue?

GEORGE: Yes, a rosy glow.

JERRY: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.

GEORGE: Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.

JERRY: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.


[Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia]

CYNTHIA: Has he ever been married?

ELAINE: No.

CYNTHIA: Has he been close?

ELAINE: He once spent a weekend with a woman.

CYNTHIA: He didn't really try to poison his boss?

ELAINE: Yeah, he did.


[The next day, George is back at Jerry's]

GEORGE: We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?

JERRY: I think it's tamber.

GEORGE: Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?

JERRY: I didn't notice the voice.

GEORGE: It's mellifluous!

JERRY: So, Saturday night.

GEORGE: She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.

(Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Hey! Saturday night!

ELAINE: I know!

GEORGE: So, what did she say?

ELAINE: She said you're getting together Saturday night!

GEORGE: That's it?

ELAINE: Yeah!

GEORGE: She didn't mention anything about the conversation?

ELAINE: No.

GEORGE: Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: She could have mentioned the conversation.

GEORGE: Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?

JERRY: Oh, the guy from Jersey?

KRAMER: Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.

GEORGE: What are you gonna do with all of them?

KRAMER: Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.

JERRY: No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.

KRAMER: Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.

ELAINE: Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

GEORGE: I'll take one. It's possible.


[Mid-episode monologue]

The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" (nods) "Have a nice day." "You too."


[Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.]

JERRY: So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?

ELAINE: I think they went out to dinner.

JERRY: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?

GEORGE: Yeah, it's me, I just got home.

JERRY: Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.

JERRY: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.

ELAINE: Remember our pact. Full disclosure.

JERRY: Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.

GEORGE: Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.

JERRY: You can tell me, I'll vault it.

GEORGE: It's in the vault?

JERRY: I'm locking the vault. What?

GEORGE: We had sex.

JERRY: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?

GEORGE: I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.

JERRY: At your apartment?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: She didn't stay over?

GEORGE: No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.

[Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.]

ELAINE: Oh my god.

CYNTHIA: He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.

ELAINE: So? How was it?

CYNTHIA: How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.

ELAINE: Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.

CYNTHIA: Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.

ELAINE: Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?

JERRY: So, what did she have to say?

ELAINE: What did he have to say?

JERRY: He said they had a good time.

ELAINE: Her too.

JERRY: Oh, good.

ELAINE: Anything else?

JERRY: Nope. You?

ELAINE: Nope.

JERRY: You sure?

ELAINE: Yup. You?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.

JERRY: Yeah. Okay then.

ELAINE: Alright. Goodnight.

JERRY: Goodnight.


[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.

JERRY: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.

GEORGE: What are you gonna do?

JERRY: Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.

GEORGE: I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.

JERRY: I'm gonna call her.

GEORGE: No, don't call her.

JERRY: No, I'm calling her.

GEORGE: No, Jerry, don't call.

JERRY: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.

GEORGE: I don't want you to call.

JERRY: Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.

GEORGE: Give me the phone!

JERRY: George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?

GEORGE: Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!

Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.

KRAMER: Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!

JERRY: I'll just call her when you leave!

GEORGE: You can't do that, it's none of your business!

JERRY: It is so my business!

KRAMER: Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!

GEORGE: But tell him to give me the--

KRAMER: Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Yeah, but--

KRAMER: Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.

JERRY: But Kramer--

KRAMER: Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.

(Jerry and George shake hands)

KRAMER: Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: Right.

GEORGE: Defective?!

KRAMER: Defective.

GEORGE: (attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!

KRAMER: I didn't even know they were defective.

(Jerry gets between them to break up the fight)

KRAMER: Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.

GEORGE: What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!

JERRY: Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!


[Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia]

CYNTHIA: I missed my period.

ELAINE: Oh my god.

CYNTHIA: I am very worried, I am never late.

ELAINE: But he used a condom, right?

CYNTHIA: I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.

ELAINE: Oh no.

CYNTHIA: What?

ELAINE: Was it blue?

CYNTHIA: Yeah. How'd you know?

ELAINE: Just a hunch.


[Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.]

JERRY: Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!

(Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.)

JERRY: Oh, hi. Soda?

ELAINE: No thanks.

JERRY: So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

ELAINE: Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.

JERRY: Oh, I know her. I know her type.

ELAINE: Her type? What type?

JERRY: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!

ELAINE: You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!

JERRY: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.

ELAINE: She's not bitter!

JERRY: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!

ELAINE: Twisted? God, I did you a favor.

JERRY: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?

ELAINE: Are you calling me a liar?

JERRY: I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?

ELAINE: Are you?

JERRY: Get your finger out of my face.

ELAINE: You get yours out, I was here first!

JERRY: I don't care.

ELAINE: Get it out!

(Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets in the middle.)

KRAMER: Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.

ELAINE: I knew those condoms were defective!

JERRY: How did you know they were defective?!

(George walks in.)

ELAINE: Because! Because she missed her period!

GEORGE: She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!

(George rushes out, hysterical.)


[Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant]

CYNTHIA: So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.

ELAINE: Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.

CYNTHIA: I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period." And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--

(George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.)

ELAINE: Hi!

GEORGE: Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.

ELAINE: What happened?

JERRY: Acting.

ELAINE: Very mature.

JERRY: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.

CYNTHIA: Hi.

JERRY: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.

CYNTHIA: Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.

GEORGE: (hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.

JERRY: So what are these?

ELAINE: Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.

(George starts eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the idea that the relationship has just ended.)

GEORGE: (with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.


[Closing monologue]

Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed up Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. She's very free about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with a snake, I think that's over though."

To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.


[Gym Locker Room]

KRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.

GEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.

JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.

GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.

JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.

GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!

JERRY: You chuck.

GEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?

KRAMER: You're a chucker.

GEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?

JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.

KRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.

JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.

KRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?

JERRY: No, did you?

KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?

GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.

JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.

KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.

JERRY: All right

KRAMER: Have a good one.

JERRY: All right

GEORGE: See ya.

(Kramer exits)

GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?

JERRY: You know who that is? That's

GEORGE: Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?

JERRY: Yeah, that's him.

GEORGE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Positive.

GEORGE: Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.

JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.

GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff

JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.

GEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension

JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?

GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.

JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.

GEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.

JERRY: So?

GEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!

JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.

GEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.

KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

JERRY: Really?

KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do.

JERRY: What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time

GEORGE: Mine too.

KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson

JERRY: Thank you.

GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...

KEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?

JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.

GEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.

JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.

KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee

JERRY: Oh. that would be great.

GEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.

KEITH: Who's this chucker?


[Monks]

JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.

ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.

JERRY: I can't ... I can't

ELAINE: Why not?

JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.

ELAINE: What's the difference?

JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.

ELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.

JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?

ELAINE: I'm sorry honey.

JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.

ELAINE: No,

JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.

ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.

JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!

ELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?

JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?

ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?

JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?

ELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.

JERRY: For what dinner?

ELAINE: Dinner's good.

JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?

ELAINE: Jerry, He's A GUY!

JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.


[Middle Monologue]

When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food. They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend, they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!


[New York State Department of Labor]

MRS. SOKOL: You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.

GEORGE: Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.

MRS. SOKOL: So where have you been looking for work?

GEORGE: Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.

MRS. SOKOL: Can you be specific about any of these companies?

GEORGE: Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..

MRS. SOKOL: Well just give me one name.

GEORGE: Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.

MRS. SOKOL: And what type of company is that?

GEORGE: Latex, latex manufacturing

MRS. SOKOL: And you interviewed there?

GEORGE: Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.

MRS. SOKOL: I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this uh, Vandelay company...

GOERGE: You like gum? 'Cause I have a friend in the gum business. I got a gum guy. I make one phone call. I got boxes of delivered right to your door.

GEORGE: Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.

(George runs down hall)


[Street phone booth- George pulls kid out of booth]

GEORGE: (Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.


[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: (loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?

JERRY: Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?

ELAINE: Jerry, ... He's a GUY!

KRAMER: well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.

KRAMER: ... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.


[Phone Booth]

GEORGE: hitting phone


[Cop bangs on booth with kid beside him]

(George looks at him)


[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.

JERRY: Oh, see the baby again with the baby..

ELAINE: Who are they?

JERRY: Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.

JERRY: (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?

ELAINE: You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.

JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.

ELAINE: yeah ha ha ha

JERRY: Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?

KRAMER: (does a double take) It's too busy

ELAINE: It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.

KRAMER: What guy?

JERRY: I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.

KRAMER: Who are you talkin about?

JERRY: Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.

KRAMER: KEITH HERNANDEZ?

NEWMAN: (enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?


[In cab]

GEORGE: Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.

(changes lanes)

GEORGE: You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -

CABBY: That's it GET OUT!!

GEORGE: Get out?

CABBY: Get out of my cab.

GEORGE: Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab

(Cabby gets out)

GEORGE: No, no! You can't throw me out

(Wrestling in cab)


[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: Hellooo Newman.

KRAMER: I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.

NEWMAN: I despise him.

ELAINE: Why?

NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...

KRAMER: Let me tell it ..

NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..

KRAMER: You always tell it ..

NEWMAN: All right, tell it.

KRAMER: Ja ja ja - just tell it

NEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.

NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.

ELAINE: What was it?

KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.

ELAINE: Wow! What a story.

JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.

JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.

[THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM; SCENE IN
THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!]

NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.

JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?

KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left

JERRY: Again

KRAMER: Back and to the left

JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left

ELAINE: So, what are you saying?

JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

ELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.

JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.

NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)

KRAMER: Wait, wait, (Exits)

JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.

(George runs in)

GEORGE: (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?

JERRY: No. What happened to you?

GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".

JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And what is that?

GEORGE: You're in latex

JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?

GEORGE: Ya manufacture it.

ELAINE: Here in this little apartment?

JERRY: And what do I say about you?

GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.

JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?

GEORGE: Because I asked you to.

JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.

(Buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: It's Keith.

JERRY: All right we're coming down.

GEORGE: KEITH HERNANDEZ:?

JERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.

GEORGE: Where are you goin?

ELAINE: He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?

JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.

GEORGE: What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)


[Keith's car]

JERRY: Well that was really fun, thanks.

KEITH: Yeah, it really was.

JERRY: (smiling) Yeah

GEORGE: What kind of a shake does he have?

JERRY: Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.

GEORGE: So, uh, you gonna see him again?

JERRY: He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.

GEORGE: Wow! The weekend.

JERRY: So then as I was getting out of the car, ...

ELAINE: And you feel you're not really ready for,…

JERRY: Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?


[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: What's going on?

JERRY: Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.

KRAMER: What? Well, you hardly know the guy…. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?

JERRY: … I said yes.

KRAMER: YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?

JERRY: I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..

KRAMER: yeah yeah

JERRY: hey Kramer do me a favour .

[Fitzpatrick's Bar]

KRAMER: Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.

ELAINE: (chuckles)

KRAMER: I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.

ELAINE: Ha, I didn't mention it.

KRAMER: Well I won them anyway.

ELAINE: Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.

KRAMER: Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.

ELAINE: ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.

KRAMER: The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.

ELAINE: Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?

KRAMER: Funny.

JERRY: She likes him I mean she really likes him.

GEORGE: How do you kn ow?

JERRY: Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.

GEORGE: I suppose he's an attractive man, I , …

JERRY: Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.

GEORGE: Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?

JERRY: You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.

GEORGE: You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?

JERRY: I don't know … six three.

GEORGE: Wow, … god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.

JERRY: So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.

GEORGE: Magellan? You like Magellan?

JERRY: Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.

GEORGE: Who do you like?

GEORGE: I like DeSoto.

JERRY: DeSoto? What did he do?

GEORGE: Discovered the Mississippi.

JERRY: Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.

GEORGE: All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?

JERRY: No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.

GEORGE: What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.

JERRY: I know isn't that something?

KRAMER: He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

JERRY: I don't know … he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.

GEORGE: The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..

JERRY: I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!


[New York State Department of lab or]

GEORGE: I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.

MRS. SOKOL: Sign here please.

GEORGE: Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.

MRS. SOKOL: All right just sign it. People are waiting.

GEORGE: You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]

MRS. SOKOL: That was autographed by the '86 Mets. I saw every inning that year.

GEORGE: Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.

MRS. SOKOL: You know Keith Hernandez.

GEORGE: Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?

MRS. SOKOL: Oh, come on. Come on.

GEORGE: I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.

MRS. SOKOL: All right. You got ONE hour.

GEORGE: All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.

(George slowly leave the office then takes off down the hallway)


[Same phone booth as part one]

(George sees large construction worker in booth and leaves. he hops into a cab)

GEORGE: 129 west 81st street and hurry.

(same cabby as part one; stares at him)

GEORGE: Goodbye (exits cab)


[Jerry's Apartment]

KEITH: Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.

JERRY: Is there a box spring?

KEITH: What's that?

JERRY: Is there a box spring?

KEITH: Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.

JERRY: Is that a sectional?

KEITH: Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> …coffee table.

JERRY: Is that a thick marble?


[… Jerry and Keith start to laugh and Jerry walks behind Keith so they don't make eye
contact and break up]

KEITH: Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.

JERRY: STAIRS??? There's no elevator?

KEITH: Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

JERRY: I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.

(Kramer enters, sees Keith and does a double take)

KRAMER: Hello.

KEITH: Hello.

KRAMER: Oh, you don't remember me.

KEITH: No should I [continuity error: in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]

KRAMER: Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.

(Newman enters)

NEWMAN: June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.

KEITH: YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."

KRAMER: Ah, you remember.

NEWMAN: And then you spit on us.

KEITH: Hey, I didn't spit at you.

NEWMAN: Oh, yeah, right.

KRAMER: No no no, well, then who was it?

KEITH: Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. … Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.

JERRY: I told you!

NEWMAN: Wow, it was McDowell.

JERRY: But why? Why McDowell?

KRAMER: Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.

NEWMAN: He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.

NEWMAN: It was McDowell.

KRAMER: Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.

NEWMAN: Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.

KEITH: look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.

KRAMER: Wait, uh what are ya' doing?

KEITH: I gotta move.

KRAMER: Want any help?

KEITH: I'd love some.

KRAMER: I'd love to help you move.

NEWMAN: Me too.

KEITH: Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.

KRAMER: No sweat.

(Kramer and Newman exit)

(phone rings)

JERRY: Hello, … oh hi Elaine .. what's going on … no he just left … you broke up with him? … ME TOO .. what happened? … oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope … me … nah … I couldn't go through with it … I just didn't feel ready … so what are you doing now? … Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.

(George frantically enters)

GEORGE: Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?

JERRY: You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?

GEORGE: (out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend … the guy from the locker room, … I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.

(sits down)

JERRY: Well Biff/ What's next?

GEORGE: I don't know.

(Tall girl enters)

TALL GIRL: Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.


[Ending Monologue]

When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about is boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the street going in and out of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean it's all you think about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. Shut up I'm looking for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it you can smell them. You walk into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Dammit, I can SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard in the morning. You could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and your looking at the casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice handles on it. And that's what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask to help you with a big move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've been waiting for your whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.

Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.


[George is at the airport]

GEORGE: It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?

(The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the other side.)

GEORGE: Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?

MAN: There's a clock over there.

GEORGE: Where?

MAN: (pointing) There.

GEORGE: But you have a watch on.

MAN: It's right by the escalator.

GEORGE: Why don't you just look at your watch?

MAN: I told you, it's right over there.

GEORGE: Let me see the watch.

(George grabs the man's wrist.)

MAN: Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!

GEORGE: You know we're living in a society!

(Jerry walks up from the ramp.)

JERRY: George.

GEORGE: Jerry. Jerry.

JERRY: Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?

GEORGE: I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.

JERRY: Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.

GEORGE: One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.

JERRY: So you have no car?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: So what good are you?

Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says O'BRIEN

JERRY: I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.

GEORGE: How do you know?

JERRY: He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.

GEORGE: We should take his limo.

JERRY: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.

JERRY: He's definitely in Chicago.

GEORGE: Well the guy's just standing there.

JERRY: How would we do it?

GEORGE: We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."

JERRY: Maybe he knows O'Brien?

GEORGE: No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.

JERRY: What if we get caught?

GEORGE: What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.

JERRY: Who's gonna be O'Brien?

GEORGE: I'll be O'Brien.

JERRY: Who am I?

GEORGE: You're you.

JERRY: Just me?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Okay.

GEORGE: What, you don't want to be you?

JERRY: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?

GEORGE: Like who?

JERRY: Dylan Murphy.

(George mumbles something.)

JERRY: What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?

GEORGE: Well I like Dylan.

JERRY: You could be Colin.

GEORGE: Colin O'Brien.

JERRY: I'm Dylan Murphy.

GEORGE: I'm Colin O'Brien.

(They walk towards the chauffeur.)

GEORGE: Are we really doing this?

JERRY: Come on,

MAN: (to George) Hey, do you have the time?

GEORGE: Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.

CHAUFFEUR: Yes sir.

GEORGE: Sorry we're late.

CHAUFFEUR: Here let me take that for you.

GEORGE: Oh thank you.

CHAUFFEUR: I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.

GEORGE: Thank you very much. Dylan?

JERRY: Colin?


[George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.]

GEORGE: This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!

JERRY: She happy for you?

GEORGE: Can he hear us?

JERRY: No. Why?

GEORGE: I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.

JERRY: He can't hear us.

GEORGE: Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.

JERRY: Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?

GEORGE: We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?

CHAUFFEUR: Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.

GEORGE: Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!

JERRY: We're going to the Knick game!

GEORGE: Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!

JERRY: I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!

GEORGE: You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?

JERRY: Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.

GEORGE: If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'

JERRY: Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.

CHAUFFEUR: I know.

Jerry and GEORGE: He knows?

GEORGE: Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?

JERRY: Maybe it's a shortcut.

GEORGE: We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.

JERRY: (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?

CHAUFFEUR: Pick up the other members of your party.

GEORGE: Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.

JERRY: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.

GEORGE: It was a good jig.

JERRY: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.

GEORGE: There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.

JERRY: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.

GEORGE: Well you should have been O'Brien.

JERRY: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?

GEORGE: Yes, you have to be Murphy.

JERRY: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.

GEORGE: You're Murphy!

JERRY: I'm Seinfeld!

GEORGE: You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.

JERRY: We're doing sixty miles an hour!

GEORGE: So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.

JERRY: Who are you, Mannix?

GEORGE: We're slowing down. Are those the people?

JERRY: Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.

(The limo pulls over, two people, a man (Tim) and a woman (Eva), get in.)

WOMAN: (reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?

JERRY: No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.

EVA: (whispering) Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.

JERRY: Newsletter?

TIM: And of course, his great book, "The Game".

JERRY: Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?

EVA: No.

JERRY: Never seen a picture of him?

EVA: Never.

JERRY: Not even on the book jacket?

EVA: There was no picture on the book jacket.

JERRY: (nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.

GEORGE: Hello. I'm O'Brien.


[Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner.]

KRAMER: Hey!

ELAINE: Hey!

KRAMER: What, you took a cab?

ELAINE: Yeah? So?

KRAMER: How much do you make?

ELAINE: I'm not telling you.

KRAMER: C'mon.

ELAINE: No!

KRAMER: I'll tell you how much I make.

ELAINE: I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.

KRAMER: You ever seen Michael Jordan?

ELAINE: Just in those commercials.

KRAMER: Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.

ELAINE: What's that?

KRAMER: Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.

ELAINE: Huh?

KRAMER: Yeah.

(Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of garbage cans.)


[Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.]

JERRY: (checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.

TIM: You think someone's been tipped off?

GEORGE: So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?

EVA: (fawning) Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.

GEORGE: Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".

EVA: Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.

GEORGE: Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.

TIM: Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.

GEORGE: Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.

JERRY: He tends to exaggerate.

GEORGE: Okay, I mean it's serious but--

EVA: We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.

GEORGE: Uh, my speech?

EVA: Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?

JERRY: Well you might as well look it over.


[Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.]

KRAMER: So what's going on, how did all this happen?

ELAINE: Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

KRAMER: Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.

ELAINE: He did.

KRAMER: Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?

ELAINE: I don't know.

KRAMER: That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?

ELAINE: Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.

KRAMER: O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?


[Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.]

GEORGE: ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.

JERRY: You're not going to open with that, are you?

EVA: What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?

GEORGE: I said so many things.

(Suddenly they hear a loud bang.)

GEORGE: They're shooting! They're shooting!

TIM: (pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!

(The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, Eva has fallen on top of George.)

EVA. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.

GEORGE: That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.

EVA: But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.

(Tim returns.)

TIM: Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.

Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling it sensually.

JERRY: Nice looking Lugar.

JODI: I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.


[Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.]

KRAMER: Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?

(A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized Elaine.)

DAN: Elaine?

ELAINE: Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?

DAN: Good.

ELAINE: Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.

DAN: Oh, Kramer?

(They shake hands.)

ELAINE: What's going on?

DAN: Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.

ELAINE: Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

DAN: Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.

ELAINE: Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.

DAN: Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.

KRAMER: Who?

DAN: The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.


[Cut back to the limo.]

(Jerry and George are alone inside.)

JERRY: What's taking him so long out there?

GEORGE: Didja see the way she was looking at me?

JERRY: She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!

GEORGE: I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.

JERRY: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Let's just make a run for it.

GEORGE: I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.

JERRY: How'd that happen?

GEORGE: I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.

JERRY: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.

GEORGE: For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.

(George grabs the phone and dials.)

GEORGE: 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--

(Tim re-enters the limo.)

GEORGE: --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.

TIM: We'll be ready in a minute.

GEORGE: Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.

TIM: With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.

GEORGE: Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?

TIM: You are.

GEORGE: And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?

TIM: You are.

GEORGE: Good. I think you forgot something.

TIM: I'm sorry.

GEORGE: Good. Now get out.

(Tim leaves.)

GEORGE: Okay, what are we gonna do?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.

JERRY: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.


[Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.]

KRAMER: I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.

ELAINE: I'm sure he was just joking around.

KRAMER: Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!

ELAINE: What is it?

KRAMER: Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!

ELAINE: Jerry's a nazi?!

KRAMER: I can't believe I didn't see it.

ELAINE: Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.

KRAMER: You don't think so.

ELAINE: No, he's just neat.


[Cut back to the limo]

TIM: You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.

GEORGE: Me??

(George and Jerry laugh nervously.)

TIM: And you really don't look like a Murphy.

JERRY: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.

GEORGE: He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.

TIM: Where are you from?

JERRY: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.

TIM: Sounds more like Scottish.

JERRY: We were right on the border.


[Cut back to the street corner]

KRAMER: Maybe he's with the company.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.

ELAINE: What about his comedy act?

KRAMER: That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.

ELAINE: What about George?

KRAMER: What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!

ELAINE: I'll bet they were even in on it.

KRAMER: Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.

ELAINE: Kramer, you're hurting me!


[Quick cut to the now approaching limo.]

GEORGE: Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.

ELAINE: Get off of me!!

(The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.)

KRAMER: O'Brien.

(This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby bus stop.)

MAN #1: O'Brien? Is that him?

MAN #2: Yeah, that's him.

MAN #3: Look there's O'Brien!

MAN #4: Filthy nazi bastard!

ALL FOUR MEN: Let's get him!!

(They begin running full speed towards the gang.)

GEORGE: What do I do?! What do I do?!

JERRY: Get in the car! Get in the car!

(George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.)

KRAMER: (pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?

TIM: Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?

JERRY: No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.

ELAINE: It could be very confusing.

(The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.)

KRAMER: Yeah? Eva?

EVA: It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.

KRAMER: O'Brien? Well that's weird.

EVA: (gun drawn) Who are you?

(George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car broke down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.)


[Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.]

JODI: A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.


[Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three are intelligible at this point.]

JODI: They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.

Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming unnerved.

EVA: Get out!!

ELAINE: Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!

DAN: Elaine?

ELAINE: Hey!


[Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.]

GEORGE: I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!


[Closing monologue]

So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie and there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they would do and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil, remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how are ya, is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the copier? Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, nice to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?

[Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at home in her bed]

ELAINE: You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?

JERRY: It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.

(Driver cuts in front of Jerry)

JERRY: Oh look at this guy.

ELAINE: What's goin' on?

JERRY: Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.

ELAINE: Did you get a thank you wave?

JERRY: No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?

(Jerry sticks his head out the window)

JERRY: Give me that wave!

ELAINE: Jerry, are you free on Friday?

JERRY: Yeah, I'm free, why?

ELAINE: Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.

JERRY: Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!

ELAINE: You gotta follow that car!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: You can't let him get away with that!

JERRY: Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.

ELAINE: What are you, yellow?

JERRY: I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)

ELAINE: Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.

JERRY: Wait, he stopped, he's parking.

ELAINE: What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?


[Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront other driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman]

JERRY: Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.

(They both smile flirtatiously at each other)


[Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are talking by the table]

JERRY: So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.

GEORGE: Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.

JERRY: You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.

(Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate)

JERRY: He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)

GEORGE: I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?

JERRY: Let's not even analyze it.

(Jerry begins walking towards door)

GEORGE: So you didn't turn her in?

JERRY: I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.

GEORGE: Gonna see her again?

JERRY: Friday night.

(Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button)

JERRY: Yep.

ELAINE: It's me!

JERRY: Come on up.

(Jerry unlocks and opens door)

JERRY: By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.

GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! I dig.

(George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups)

JERRY: Oh, you dig?

GEORGE: Yes! I see enormous potential here.

JERRY: Why?

(George pours two cups of milk)

GEORGE: Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.

JERRY: I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.

GEORGE: I don't think so.

JERRY: Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!

(Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent)

JERRY: On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!

(Jerry looks at his cup in disgust)

JERRY: What am I drinking, milk?

(Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket)

ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hi.

(Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry)

ELAINE: Sweater.

JERRY: Thank you.

ELAINE: So? What happened?

(Jerry starts walking away)

JERRY: With that?

ELAINE: With the car!

JERRY: What car?

ELAINE: The hit and run!

JERRY: Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.

ELAINE: Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?

JERRY: Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)

(George walks out of the kitchen)

GEORGE: Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.

JERRY: Yeah, Queens.

ELAINE: So? Then what?

JERRY: So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"

(Elaine gasps)

JERRY: So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."

(Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement)

ELAINE: I am speechless. I am without speech.

GEORGE: Tell her about the shoving.

JERRY: What?

(George smiles pointing at him)

ELAINE: What shoving?!

JERRY: Oh, it was nothing.

GEORGE: No! Tell her.

(Jerry looks at George with a grin)
JERRY: Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)

ELAINE: You know karate??

JERRY: I know a little.

ELAINE: Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?

JERRY: He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey! (Group does likewise)

ELAINE: Did you tell Kramer?

JERRY: Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)

KRAMER: What? What? What? Tell me.

ELAINE: Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.

(Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling)

KRAMER: Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)

KRAMER: They should be sent to Australia.

(Jerry has a confused look)

JERRY: Australia?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.

JERRY: But not anymore.

KRAMER: No.

(Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer)

ELAINE: Hey Kramer, Kramer!

KRAMER: Yeah?

ELAINE: What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)

KRAMER: I don't know!

(Jerry smiles and shakes his head)

KRAMER: You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.

(Elaine has a look of surprise)

ELAINE: Well, that is, that is strange.

KRAMER: Yep. (Mumbles off)

(Elaine walks toward door)

ELAINE: Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?

JERRY: Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.

(Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry)

ELAINE: But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)

JERRY: We just met.

(Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger)

KRAMER: Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.

ELAINE: But I, I can't go alone!

JERRY: Ask George to go with you.

ELAINE: George, come on! I'll pay for you.

GEORGE: You'll pay? I'm there.

JERRY: Why do you even need anybody?

ELAINE: Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)


[Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married couple,]

Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused on eating his meal)

ROBIN: You went out with a bullfighter?

ELAINE: Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.

MICHAEL: Wow.

ROBIN: What was his name?

ELAINE: His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.

(George points across the table)

GEORGE: Pass the salt please.

ROBIN: Where did you meet him?

ELAINE: Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.

(Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread)

GEORGE: Bread.

(Elaine hands bread to George)

ELAINE: I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.

(Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and looks at Michael)

GEORGE: God bless you.

(Robin smiles)

ROBIN: Thank you.

GEORGE: I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)

(Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)


[Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman are both eating an ice cream cones]

WOMAN: You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.

JERRY: Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.

WOMAN: Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

JERRY: Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.

(Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling)

WOMAN: Come here. (moves in for a kiss)


[Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed between Michael and George]
GEORGE: Really, I was, I was only kidding around.

ROBIN: He was only joking Michael.

(Michael throws down his serviette)

MICHAEL: You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?

GEORGE: No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.

ROBIN: He was only joking Michael! Sorry.

MICHAEL: All right! Take his side!

ROBIN: I am not taking his side.

MICHAEL: Well who's side are you taking?!

ROBIN: Well I'm not taking your side!

(Robin sneezes, George gestures to Michael that the floor is his)


[Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run woman are now kissing]

JERRY: Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.

(Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)


[Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment with George talking outside Jerry's room]

GEORGE: I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?

JERRY: The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.

(George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks over and presses the button)

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen)

GEORGE: Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.

JERRY: No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.

GEORGE: Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.

JERRY: What if she's having an off night?

(Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa)

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hi.

(Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen)

ELAINE: Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!

(George walks out of kitchen)

GEORGE: Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.

(Jerry sneezes)

GEORGE: Ah, shut up.

ELAINE: What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.

(Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa)

JERRY: A stupid what?

(Elaine looks at Jerry)

ELAINE: Whatever.

JERRY: You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.

(Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes)

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.

GEORGE: Who?

ELAINE: Robin!

(George looks quickly at Elaine)

GEORGE: Why?!

ELAINE: Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.

(George stands up)

JERRY: Entertainment Tonight's on.

GEORGE: Where's the remote phone?

JERRY: Bedroom.

(George walks toward Jerry's bedroom)

ELAINE: Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?

(Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and Elaine, then walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice of Mary Hart starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the sofa.)

JERRY: What's it like out?

(Kramer continues to shake behind sofa)

ELAINE: Chilly out.

JERRY: Can I take a sweater?

ELAINE: Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.

JERRY: Scarf?

ELAINE: Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.

(Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes)

JERRY: What's the matter? What's going on?

(Kramer is looking around like he's lost)

KRAMER: What happened?!

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: I think I hit my head again!

JERRY: What is wrong?!

(Elaine is pointing at the TV)

ELAINE: Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?

KRAMER: Yeah.

(Elaine claps her hands together then stands up)

ELAINE: That is it!

KRAMER: What?

(Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him)

ELAINE: That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!

(George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits down)

KRAMER: Mary Hart!

GEORGE: God.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.

JERRY: Get together?

GEORGE: Maybe she just wants to talk to me?

ELAINE: Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.

(George walks to other side of sofa)

GEORGE: Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.

(George sits on chair)

ELAINE: Are you actually considering this?

GEORGE: I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!

ELAINE: Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.

(Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable)

JERRY: Yeah.

(Kramer walks out of washroom)

KRAMER: Hey, you know who owns that car?

JERRY: What car?

KRAMER: The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.

JERRY: Yeah who?

KRAMER: That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.

(Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen)

JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.

(Elaine nods, smiling)

ELAINE: Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.

(Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows)

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?

(Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very excited)

JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants!

GEORGE: Well, who is she?

JERRY: I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.

GEORGE: Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.

(Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)

JERRY: Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!

(Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)

GEORGE: You can't compromise your principles!

JERRY: How am I going to live with myself?!

GEORGE: Can't live!

JERRY: I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!

GEORGE: This country needs more people like you!

JERRY: Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.

GEORGE: I believe strongly in that as you know.

JERRY: There should be more people like us.

GEORGE: That's why the world's in the shape it's in.

JERRY: You're telling me.

(Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading their magazines)


[Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking to the girl with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door]

JERRY: Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.

(Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling)

BECKY: Well God bless you.

(Jerry pauses)

JERRY: Thank you very much.


[Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are together in bed]

GEORGE: Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?

ROBIN: Oh no, what's wrong?

GEORGE: What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!

ROBIN: You didn't commit adultery, I did.

GEORGE: Oh yeah.

ROBIN: If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.

GEORGE: Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.

ROBIN: Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.

GEORGE: Well, that's a given.

ROBIN: In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.

GEORGE: Must be hell living in that house.


[Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the phone to Michael]

MICHAEL: Hi, it's Michael.

ELAINE: Hi, Michael!

MICHAEL: Is Robin there?

ELAINE: Robin? No, why?

MICHAEL: Uh, she said she was going to be with you.

ELAINE: No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.

(Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)

MICHAEL: If she's not with you, then where is she?

ELAINE: Well I, I don't know.

MICHAEL: Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!

ELAINE: No, no, come on Michael!

MICHAEL: He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!

(Michael sneezes)

ELAINE: You're soo good lookin'.


[Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela are talking by the sofa]

ANGELA: Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!

JERRY: Let me rephra-

ANGELA: I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!

(Elaine walks in)

JERRY: Hi Elaine, this is Angela.

ANGELA: I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!

(Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen)

JERRY: Well I think I get the gist of it.

ANGELA: So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!

(Jerry shrugs)

JERRY: What car?

(Jerry hands Angela her purse)

ANGELA: Good. I'm glad we understand each other.

JERRY: It's not complicated.

(Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves)

ELAINE: Very nice meeting you!

(Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)

ELAINE: Come on up.

(Elaine laughs)

ELAINE: Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.

JERRY: Alright Elaine.

ELAINE: No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!

JERRY: It was just a couple of blocks.

(Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter)

ELAINE: Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!

(George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward him, Jerry goes to washroom)

GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Oh, did you check you machine?

(George takes glass from cupboard)

GEORGE: No, why, what's happening?

ELAINE: Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.

GEORGE: Yeah, okay.

ELAINE: And I said I hadn't seen her.

GEORGE: What?!

ELAINE: No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.

GEORGE: He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!

ELAINE: He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.

GEORGE: What? Why couldn't you think of something?!

ELAINE: Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!

GEORGE: You lie! How hard is it to lie?!

(Jerry walks back from washroom)

JERRY: It's not that hard.

(Elaine points finger at George)

ELAINE: Well who told you to sleep with her George?!

GEORGE: It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!

ELAINE: Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!

GEORGE: Oh don't-

(Jerry raises his arms)

JERRY: Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?

GEORGE: She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.

JERRY: A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?

ELAINE: Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.

(Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador)

JERRY: Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!


[Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to her outside her door)

JERRY: Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.

BECKY: Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.

JERRY: $875?

BECKY: That's right.

JERRY: Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.

(Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing)

JERRY: Um, who do I make it out to?

BECKY: Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

JERRY: So, what are you doing this weekend?

(Jerry hands check to Becky)

BECKY: You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?

JERRY: I didn't do it!

BECKY: Yeah righ-

(Becky sneezes)

JERRY: You are soo good lookin'.

(Becky closes door)

BECKY: Thank you.


[Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in bedroom and George is looking out window]

GEORGE: Jerry, let's go! You ready?

(Jerry walks out of bedroom)

JERRY: You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!

GEORGE: Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.

JERRY: Alright!

(George put his bag over his shoulder)

GEORGE: Come on let's get out of here.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: How could you?

JERRY: What?!

KRAMER: Man! I never thought you were capable of this!

JERRY: What did I do?

KRAMER: I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.

JERRY: I-

KRAMER: I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.

JERRY: I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!

KRAMER: Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?

(Jerry is putting on sweater)

JERRY: No, never.

KRAMER: Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.

JERRY: You got a date with Becky Gelke?!

KRAMER: Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.

GEORGE: Jerry, can we get out of here?!

KRAMER: As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.

JERRY: Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.

(Jerry yanks coat out of George's hands)


[Scene moves to outside Becky's apartment. Kramer is walking toward her door, hair slicked back, with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. He knocks on her door, she opens. Mary Hart's voice is playing on the TV in the distance. Kramer starts having a violent seizure.]

(Nina’s art studio. Kramer is posing for Nina (Jerry’s current girlfriend.)

NINA: (laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I can’t do this if you keep moving.

KRAMER: You sure you don’t want me to take my clothes off? (beat) I’ll do it!

NINA: No, that’s the last thing in the world I want you to do.

KRAMER: Well, why don’t you take your clothes off?

NINA: I don’t know... I don’t think Jerry would like that.

KRAMER: (debonair smile) Well, it’d be our little secret.


[CUT TO: Jerry’s apartment]

GEORGE: (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!

JERRY: I like the button fly.

GEORGE: (incredulous) What?

JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It’s like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?

GEORGE: I don’t get art.

JERRY: There’s nothing to get.

GEORGE: Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.

JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.

GEORGE: What for?

JERRY: She sees something in him.

GEORGE: So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.


[CUT TO: Nina's studio again--same scene]

KRAMER: Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.

NINA: Tell me about Elaine.

KRAMER: She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

NINA: But, they're still friends.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).

NINA: Don't you think that's strange?

KRAMER: Why, what's the difference?

NINA: Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?

KRAMER: Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.


[CUT TO: the door outside Nina's studio]

GEORGE: You know, I'm a little nervous.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.

JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.

GEORGE: Really? I thought you liked her.

JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)

GEORGE: You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?

(Nina opens the door)

JERRY: Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.

NINA: How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)

JERRY: (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.

NINA: Oh, are you interested?

GEORGE: (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.

KRAMER: George, you gonna buy a painting?

GEORGE: (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.

NINA: Are you an art-lover?

GEORGE: I am an art-adorer! I adore art.

NINA: Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)

JERRY: May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)

NINA: (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)

JERRY: What's this?

NINA: My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.

JERRY: (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.

NINA: Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?

KRAMER: (immediately) Yeah.

JERRY: They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!

GEORGE: Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?

NINA: Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.

GEORGE: All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!

NINA: (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?


[CUT TO: Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead to their seats]

GEORGE: Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?

USHER: No, no, these are your seats.

GEORGE: She said first row! Right behind the dugout!

ELAINE: Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.

GEORGE: I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!

ELAINE: Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.

GEORGE: Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.

KRAMER: Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!

ELAINE: I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.

GEORGE: (amused) You're supposed to do that?

ELAINE: (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?

GEORGE: I'd rather go to a hanging.

ELAINE: Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)

KRAMER: (screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,

JOHNNY, 'CAUSE THIS AIN'T PHILIDELPHIA!!

(a man approaches the trio)

MAN: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

MAN: Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.

GEORGE: Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--

ELAINE: Hi!

KRAMER: (screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!

GEORGE: --and this is Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh, hey.

(the Yankees make a good play, the crowd applauds)

WEST: So how are the seats?

GEORGE: Okay.

ELAINE: Great, great.

KRAMER: Yeah.

WEST: George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.

GEORGE: Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?

WEST: Well, if you have a lot of money.

(Yankees make a horrible play, the crowd responds)

WEST: (leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap.

ELAINE: (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!

WEST: No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.

ELAINE: You're not serious.

WEST: Yes, yes, yes, I am!

ELAINE: Well, did he say that?

WEST: No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.

ELAINE: Well maybe you should ask him!

WEST: I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?

ELAINE: No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!

GEORGE: Just take the cap off.

ELAINE: George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!

WEST: Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.

ELAINE: Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.

GEORGE: Just take the cap off!

ELAINE: No!

(a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking off

GEORGE'S hat, and throwing it onto the field... West calls security over, they proceed to remove Elaine)

KRAMER: Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!

GEORGE: (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?

KRAMER: (getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.

ELAINE: (sarcastically, to George) Stay!

GEORGE: Okay, we'll go!

(meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's cap... the camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where Kramer is: the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto the crowd)

[END OF ACT 1]


[ACT 2]

(Jerry's apartment--day)

ELAINE: ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!

JERRY: Is he okay?

ELAINE: Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!

JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!

ELAINE: I know! Can you imagine that?

(Kramer enters with a bandage wrapper around his forehead)

JERRY: How you feeling?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.

ELAINE: Wha- a picture?

KRAMER: A picture.

ELAINE: OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??

KRAMER: Uh-huh.

(they all crowd around, looking at the picture)

ELAINE: (gasps) I cannot believe this!

JERRY: (pointing) There's George!

KRAMER: Yup, yup!

ELAINE: Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!


[CUT TO: Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.]

ELAINE: Hi, Mr. Lippman.

LIPPMAN:How's your father?

ELAINE: My, my father?

LIPPMAN:Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?

ELAINE: Yeah.

LIPPMAN:Uh-huh.

ELAINE: I went to visit him.

LIPPMAN:Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?

ELAINE: Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...

LIPPMAN:But--but he's feeling better now?

ELAINE: Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.

LIPPMAN:(correcting her) Boo-eed.

ELAINE: What--what did I say?

LIPPMAN:You said "boyed."

ELAINE: I did?

LIPPMAN:Yeah.

(Elaine starts to laugh hysterically, and at the same time discreetly removes Lippman's sports section from his desk. She manages to maneuver it into her lap, out of sight.)

LIPPMAN:Well, I got a plane to catch.

ELAINE: Oh! Where are you going?

LIPPMAN:Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?

ELAINE: Ah. ...Yeah.

LIPPMAN:I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.

ELAINE: There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...

LIPPMAN:Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?

ELAINE: Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)

LIPPMAN:Gotta go.

ELAINE: Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!


[CUT TO: Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's "Kramer."]

MRS.ARM:I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.

MR. ARM:I see a parasite.

MRS.ARM:A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.


[CUT TO: Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.]

NINA: She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.

JERRY: It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?


[CUT TO: Armstrongs admiring painting again.]

MRS.ARM:He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!

MR. ARM:He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.


[CUT TO: Jerry and Nina again.]

JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.

NINA: Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!

JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!

NINA: Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!


[CUT TO: Armstrongs]

MRS.ARM:He transcends time and space.

MR. ARM:He sickens me.

MRS.ARM:I love it.

MR. ARM:Me too.


[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment.]

GEORGE: Five-hundred dollars?! What?

JERRY: That's what she told me!

GEORGE: I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!

JERRY: That's what it costs!

GEORGE: Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!

JERRY: I wasn't thinking! I don't know.

GEORGE: You weren't thinking.

JERRY: Well, she framed it and everything.

GEORGE: Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?

JERRY: Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!

GEORGE: I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.

KRAMER: (entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.

GEORGE: Hey, Kramer.

KRAMER: Hi, Mike.

JERRY: (looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!

KRAMER: (notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!

JERRY: (reading note) Oh my god!

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!

GEORGE: What's it say?

JERRY: Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."

GEORGE: WOW!

KRAMER: (emotionally) She's deep.

JERRY: (reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"

(Kramer blows his noes loudly) "...because I'm sure as hell fighting for you!"

KRAMER: You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!

JERRY: No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!

KRAMER: (pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!

JERRY: Should I?

KRAMER: (screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!

JERRY: ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.


[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her coat. The TV is on a horse race.]

JERRY: SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?

GEORGE: (on intercom) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.

NINA: What's the appeal of the posse?

JERRY: The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.

(George enters)

NINA: Hello, George.

GEORGE: Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?

NINA: Well, I really love that piece.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.

NINA: No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!

GEORGE: This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.

NINA: Honestly, George, the money's not important.

GEORGE: Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: (on intercom) It's Elaine.

JERRY: Come on up.

NINA: Elaine?

JERRY: ...Yeah.

NINA: (rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?

JERRY: She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.

GEORGE: I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: How 'bout Kramer.

JERRY: HUGE pop-in guy!

NINA: Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?

JERRY: Yeah.

NINA: Okay.

JERRY: Okay!

NINA: Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)

ELAINE: (to Nina) Hello!

(Nina doesn't respond, just walks past Elaine)

ELAINE: (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!

JERRY: If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!

ELAINE: No, he wants to torture me.


[CUT TO: later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.]

ELAINE: (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)

JERRY: (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.

ELAINE: You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.

(another tug-o-war starts)

JERRY: Let go!

ELAINE: No, come on! I want it, Jerry!

JERRY: Let go, Elaine!

ELAINE: Well at least let George do it!

JERRY: Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)

GEORGE: (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.

(George starts clicking, the first station he lands on is playing Neil Simon's Chapter 2. After a few seconds, George gets bored, and changes the station)

JERRY: Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)

ELAINE: It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.

JERRY: (on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!

ELAINE: What letter?

JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!

(Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, and starts reading in unison with movie on TV.)

JERRY: "...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"

GEORGE: This is incredible!

JERRY: I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!

GEORGE: Maybe I won't send her that check.

ELAINE: You know, it's not really that terrible.

JERRY: What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!


[CUT TO: Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room]

LIPPMAN:(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?

ELAINE: Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.

LIPPMAN:Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?

ELAINE: Well, uh, fan. My father--

LIPPMAN:Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!

ELAINE: Really?

LIPPMAN:Yeah.

ELAINE: So... impudent.

LIPPMAN:Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.

ELAINE: (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--

LIPPMAN:Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.

ELAINE: (very reluctant) Okay.

LIPPMAN:Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.

ELAINE: That will be fun.


[CUT TO: Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her, sitting on the sofa.]

JERRY: How's it coming?

NINA: Good, good.

JERRY: Seen any good movies lately?

NINA: No... not really. You?

JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?

NINA: Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.

JERRY: I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?

NINA: I don't know... maybe.

JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)

MR. ARM:Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."


[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball game and talking.]

GEORGE: Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)

JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!

GEORGE: So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?

JERRY: Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?

GEORGE: Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.

(the Yankees announcer is heard on TV)

TVVOICE: Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.

GEORGE: Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.

TVVOICE: Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."

(Jerry and George look at each other, wondering.)


[CUT TO: the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having Kramer over for dinner.]

KRAMER: ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.

MRS.ARM: More potatoes?

KRAMER: Yeah, sure. Please.

MR. ARM:Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?

KRAMER: Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.

At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in there."


[Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.

JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.

KRAMER: Well, where is it?

JERRY: What's the difference?

KRAMER: Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.

JERRY: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?

KRAMER: What happened to the car?

JERRY: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.

JERRY: You have to know, you must know.

KRAMER: I must know.

JERRY: Well, I'm not telling you.

KRAMER: Oh, come on.

JERRY: Nope. I don't think so.

KRAMER: Well, please?

JERRY: Not today, pal.

KRAMER: Okay, I beg you.

JERRY: Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.

KRAMER: Okay, please! Please tell me!

JERRY: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.

KRAMER: Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.

JERRY: I loaned the car to George.

KRAMER: Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?

JERRY: George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!

KRAMER: Alright.

JERRY: Huh?

KRAMER: Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?

JERRY: Will you stop it already?!

KRAMER: You know, why didn't they ask me to go?

JERRY: I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!

KRAMER: What, they don't like me?

JERRY: *I* don't like you!

KRAMER: If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.



[George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.]

GEORGE: I really think it looks good.

ELAINE: Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?

GEORGE: All bald people look good in hats.

ELAINE: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.

GEORGE: What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.

ELAINE: Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?

GEORGE: No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.

ELAINE: Are you sure you like these sunglasses?

Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this causes George to swerve and hit something.


[Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.]

KRAMER: Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?

JERRY: Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.

(Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.)

KRAMER: Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?

JERRY: No, I like Mike.

KRAMER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.

JERRY: Oh yeah? What did you talk about?

KRAMER: Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.

JERRY: Oh yeah? What did he say?

KRAMER: You have to know everything, don't you?

JERRY: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?

KRAMER: Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?

JERRY: Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.

KRAMER: Beg me.

JERRY: Please, don't make me beg.

KRAMER: No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.

JERRY: Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.

KRAMER: No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...

JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.

JERRY: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.

KRAMER: Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.

JERRY: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!

KRAMER: He thinks you're a phony.

JERRY: He what?

KRAMER: I told you, he thinks you're a phony.

JERRY: A phony? He called me a phony?

KRAMER: A big phone. A big one.

JERRY: Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!

KRAMER: You begged me.


[Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking noise.]

GEORGE: Do you hear that?

ELAINE: Of course I hear that.

GEORGE: You had to move the mirror?

ELAINE: I wanted to check out my sunglasses.

GEORGE: I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.

GEORGE: I can't drive?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.

ELAINE: No, I really don't.

GEORGE: And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.

ELAINE: I'm sure you could.

GEORGE: What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?

ELAINE: I don't know.

GEORGE: Alright, start looking for spaces.

ELAINE: Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.

GEORGE: Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.

ELAINE: Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.

GEORGE: I can't park in a garage.

ELAINE: Why?

GEORGE: I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.

ELAINE: I'll pay for it.

GEORGE: You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.

ELAINE: (pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!

GEORGE: (putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?

ELAINE: You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.

(They share a laugh.)

GEORGE: Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.

ELAINE: Will you just park it already?

GEORGE: There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!

ELAINE: George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.

GEORGE: No no no, he's not getting away with this.

ELAINE: George?

(George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.)

GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing?

MIKE: I think I'm parking my car.

GEORGE: You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.

MIKE: I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.

GEORGE: Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?

MIKE: Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.

GEORGE: I was in the middle of a conversation.

MIKE: Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

GEORGE: The point is I was here first.

MIKE: I was closer to this space than you were.

GEORGE: But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!

MIKE: I can if I have room!

GEORGE: Are you gonna move the car?

MIKE: No, I'm not gonna move the car.

GEORGE: Jerk!

MIKE: Oh, you're not?

GEORGE: Do you believe this guy?

ELAINE: Come on, we'll put it in a garage.

GEORGE: I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.

ELAINE: What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.

GEORGE: Are you coming back down?

ELAINE: Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?

ELAINE: Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.

GEORGE: Oh, come on, you're good at this.

ELAINE: What am I gonna say?

GEORGE: I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.

(Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.)


[Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.]

ELAINE: Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?

JERRY: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?

ELAINE: Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)

JERRY: (bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.

ELAINE: (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.

JERRY: He is?

ELAINE: Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.

JERRY: A gun?!

ELAINE: I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.

JERRY: My god, are you okay?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.

JERRY: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.

ELAINE: Exactly.

JERRY: Where's George now?

ELAINE: Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: Look out the window, you'll see.

JERRY: (leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!

GEORGE: Hey!

JERRY: Are you okay?

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm fine.

JERRY: Crazy kids, huh?

GEORGE: What?

ELAINE: (desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.

MIKE: Is that Jerry? Jerry?!

JERRY: Oh, hey Mike.

GEORGE: What, you know Jerry?

MIKE: Yeah, I know Jerry.

GEORGE: How do you know him?

MIKE: What's the difference?

GEORGE: Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.

MIKE: Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!

JERRY: I'm coming down.

MIKE: Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?

GEORGE: What, you know Kramer?!

(Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.)

ELAINE: Hi.

KRAMER: (acting standoffish) Hello.

JERRY: Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.

KRAMER: (out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!

GEORGE: And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?

MIKE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh great.

ELAINE: You know that guy downstairs?

JERRY: Yeah, he's a real phony.

KRAMER: What's going on?!

MIKE: Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!

GEORGE: It's my space!

KRAMER: I'll be down in a minute.

ELAINE: Are you going down?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Is anything wrong?

KRAMER: (leaving) Why should anything be wrong?

ELAINE: (heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.

(Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.)

MIKE: Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.

GEORGE: I'll die out here.

(Two bystanders are discussing the incident. )

BYSTANDER #1: He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.

BYSTANDER #2: No, it doesn't matter. He was-

MIKE: Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!

JERRY: Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.

MIKE: Hey Krame! You know this guy?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know him.

MIKE: (to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?

JERRY: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.

MIKE: (laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!

GEORGE: Oh, come on.

MIKE: Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.

GEORGE: Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?

MIKE: Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.

GEORGE: You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!

MIKE: I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!

GEORGE: You've got a prayer.

KRAMER: I go in front first all the time.

JERRY: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.

(Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.)

GEORGE: Did you talk to him?

ELAINE: Yeah, it's all taken care of.

GEORGE: You told him? What did you tell him?

ELAINE: I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.

GEORGE: I don't believe it, what did you say?

ELAINE: I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.

GEORGE: A pack of teenagers?

ELAINE: Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.

GEORGE: You are a genius, it's as simple as that.

ELAINE: What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.

(Elaine and George rejoin the others.)

KRAMER: By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.

GEORGE: Oh great.

JERRY: I didn't know.

ELAINE: Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.

GEORGE: Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.

MIKE: A flea market? You went to a flea market??

GEORGE: Hey, who's talking to you?

ELAINE: We just didn't think of you.

KRAMER: You said it, sister.

GEORGE: What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?

(People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.)

GEORGE: Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.

JERRY: I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!

GEORGE: Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.

JERRY: You're right. My fault.

ELAINE: Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm sorry.

KRAMER: I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.

GEORGE: What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?

JERRY: It was a so-so sorry.

(A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.)

TRUCK DRIVER: Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!

GEORGE: You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.

MIKE: And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?

TRUCK DRIVER: Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!

ELAINE: You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.

JERRY: Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.

ELAINE: Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?

GEORGE: Uh huh.

JERRY: Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,

GEORGE: Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.

ELAINE: Right.

GEORGE: I learned a lot about myself.

JERRY: What did you do to my car?!

GEORGE: I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.

ELAINE: Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.

JERRY: I thought you said you were a good driver!

GEORGE: No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.

JERRY: I think you said driver.

GEORGE: Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.

MIKE: Will you move it up a little bit?

GEORGE: No no no, that's in the right position.

MIKE: No no, I was further in.

GEORGE: No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.

MIKE: Do you mind?

GEORGE: Do you?

SID: Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.

JERRY: Hey Sid.

MIKE: Who are you?

SID: Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?

GEORGE: Sid, it's completely his fault.

MIKE: Oh, right.

SID: Why don't you start taking the bus?

JERRY: Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.

GEORGE: Don't do it!

JERRY: What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?

GEORGE: Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.

ELAINE: Why don't you just flip a coin already?

GEORGE: No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.

ELAINE: You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.

GEORGE: So you're against me now?

(An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt store, are discussing the incident.)

ANGRY MAN: He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.

MATTHEW: No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.

ANGRY MAN: No he wasn't.

MATTHEW: All that matters is who was there first.

ANGRY MAN: Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.

MATTHEW: You just spit on me!

ANGRY MAN: Don't you raise your voice to me!

MATTHEW: You're not my father.

JERRY: Hey Matthew.

MATTHEW: Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.

JERRY: How ya doing?

MATTHEW: Okay.

JERRY: Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.

MATTHEW: What?!

JERRY: Oh no, nothing.

MATTHEW: What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?

JERRY: No, no, no, no.

MATTHEW: We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?

JERRY: No, of course not, of course not!

MATTHEW: Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?

MARYEDITH: Jerry?! What's the matter with you?

JERRY: I didn't--

MARYEDITH: (to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.

KRAMER: Oh, congratulations.

MARYEDITH: What for?

KRAMER: Well, you're pregnant.

MARYEDITH: What?

KRAMER: You're not pregnant?

MARYEDITH: No, I'm not pregnant.

KRAMER: Are you sure you're not pregnant?

MARYEDITH: Yes, I'm sure!

KRAMER: That's weird.

MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew.

MATTHEW: No.

MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew!

KRAMER: I thought she was pregnant.

JERRY: (to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Mike thinks I'm a phony.

ELAINE: He thinks you're a phony?

JERRY: Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.

ELAINE: Oh, you have to say something.

JERRY: I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.

ELAINE: You gotta open the vault.

JERRY: Open my vault?

ELAINE: Open your vault.

JERRY: Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.

ELAINE: You have no choice.

JERRY: Oy ga-vault.

Newman: (to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.

(George begins applauding.)

KRAMER: When can you park head first?

NEWMAN: Never.

MIKE: What are you asking this guy for?

NEWMAN: Who's talking to you?

GEORGE: He's right. never.

MIKE: Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?

NEWMAN: Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.

GEORGE: When do you ever have ten car lengths?

KRAMER: What about Sundays and holidays?

GEORGE: Oh please.

(A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George)

SHEILA: What's going on here?

GEORGE: Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.

SHEILA: I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.

GEORGE: Well, thank you for your support.

SHEILA: Hey, that's a great hat.

GEORGE: Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.

NEWMAN: Hey George, nice hat.

GEORGE: Yeah, thanks.

NEWMAN: Can I try it on?

GEORGE: No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.

NEWMAN: Well sure it would.

GEORGE: No! Get out of here, Newman.

NEWMAN: Come on, let me try it on.

GEORGE: No, Newman, stop it.

SHEILA: Let him try it on.

GEORGE: I don't want him to!

SHEILA: What is wrong with you?

GEORGE: You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!

NEWMAN: Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.

GEORGE: Alright, just keep the hat!

JERRY: Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?

ELAINE: It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?

KRAMER: I'm not going if he's going.

NEWMAN: Me either.

GEORGE: I'm not going if he's going.

MIKE: Well I'm going.

JERRY: Well if he's going then I'm not going.

NEWMAN: But it's your house.

JERRY: I still don't have to go.

ELAINE: Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.

MIKE: Why won't you go if I go?

JERRY: Why? I'll tell you why.

KRAMER: No. Don't, Jerry.

JERRY: Like you didn't call me a phony?

MIKE: What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.

JERRY: Use it in a sentence.

MIKE: Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?

KRAMER: He begged me.

MIKE: He begged you?!

JERRY: Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?

(Two police officers walk up.)

COP #1: Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.

GEORGE: Officer, could I just explain something to you?

COP #1: Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.

GEORGE: Officer, he can't pull in head first.

MIKE: Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
sitting there.

COP #1: Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head
first.

COP #2: Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there.

COP #1: What are you talking about? This guy was here first.

COP #2: But he didn't take it.

COP #1: Hey, it's his space.

COP #2: No, it's his space.


[Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard arguing through the window]

GEORGE: Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!

MIKE: Well, you're gonna have to go to work!

GEORGE: I don't have a job!

MIKE: Neither do I!

(Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote and turns on the TV.)

REFEREE: Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*

(Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.)


[Closing monologue]

People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they think, 'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' I think because everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's like Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem is car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year, they're not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working on. Wouldn't that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving turntable, and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.

Jerry's stand-up: So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."

Opening scene: Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.

JERRY's brain: What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.

(Jerry notices his door is open.)

JERRY's brain: What the hell...? Why is the door open?

(Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns on the light.)

JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here!?

KRAMER: Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.

JERRY: You scared me!

KRAMER: It's just me.

JERRY: That's enough!

KRAMER: Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)


[Jerry's apartment, daytime. We hear Jerry hurriedly trying to get in the door.]

JERRY (from outside the door): C'mon...c'mon...

(Jerry enters, sheds his jacket, drops his luggage and heads for the bathroom. He opens the door to find Kramer taking a bubble bath in his tub.)

JERRY: Kramer! What are you doing?!

KRAMER: What does it look like I'm doing? What?

JERRY: Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!

KRAMER: Alright, alright...

JERRY: C'mon!

KRAMER: Sorry.

JERRY: Move it! Move it! Get going!

KRAMER: My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)

JERRY (from inside the bathroom): Is that my towel?

(Kramer loses the towel in the hallway and throws it on Jerry's floor from the other side of the door.)


[Jerry's hallway at night. Jerry approaches his door with a girlfriend.]

GIRLFRIEND: I'm really happy the movie was sold out.

JERRY: Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?

GIRLFRIEND: I'm from Witchita, so...

JERRY: Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)

GIRLFRIEND: Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!

JERRY: The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)

GIRLFRIEND: That was close!

JERRY: Did you see the look on that guy's face?

GIRLFRIEND: You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)

JERRY: Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!

KRAMER: Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.

JERRY: All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.

KRAMER: Oh, come on!

JERRY: No, come on!

KRAMER: What, what, I thought you went to the movies!

JERRY: It was sold out!

KRAMER: Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?

JERRY: That's the point.

KRAMER: What point?

JERRY: Just, look, just give the keys.

KRAMER: Just give me another chance!

JERRY: Don't ask me!

KRAMER: I'm asking you!

JERRY: I'm telling you.

KRAMER: You're joking.

JERRY: I'm serious!

KRAMER: It's not going to happen again!

JERRY: Yes it will, now give me those keys!

(Jerry and Kramer begin struggling over the keys. Kramer loses his footing and falls on the floor, taking his girlfriend down with him.)

KRAMER (getting up): O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)


[Jerry's apartment, the next day. Jerry is now giving his spare keys to Elaine.]

JERRY: So put 'em in a safe place.

ELAINE: I will.

JERRY: Where?

ELAINE: I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?

JERRY: I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.

ELAINE: Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.

JERRY: I can't.

)There's a gentle knock at the door.)

ELAINE (mouths the words): Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)

JERRY: Who's there?

KRAMER (in hallway): Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...

ELAINE: Oh, I'm not, uh...

KRAMER: No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."

ELAINE: Jerry, give him the keys back.

JERRY: Elaine...

(Elaine tries to give the keys to Kramer, but Jerry won't let her. Jerry and Elaine begin struggling over the keys. Kramer breaks it up.)

KRAMER: I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.

JERRY: Take the keys.

KRAMER: I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)

JERRY: O.K.!

KRAMER: Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.

JERRY: Your spare set?

KRAMER: That's right.

JERRY: You want 'em back?

KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.

(Jerry takes a huge ring with hundreds of keys on it out of his drawer, and hands it to Kramer. Kramer begins going through them.)


[the coffee shop. Kramer is now giving the huge keyring to George.]

GEORGE: Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.

KRAMER: Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!

GEORGE: Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.

KRAMER: Well, you can get 'em back.

GEORGE: I suppose I could.

KRAMER: Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.

GEORGE: Me?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.

GEORGE: Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)

WAITRESS: Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)

KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George): Do you ever yearn?

GEORGE: Yearn? Do I yearn?

KRAMER: I yearn.

GEORGE: You yearn.

KRAMER: Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?

GEORGE: Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.

KRAMER (in disgust): Look at you.

GEORGE: Aw, Kramer, don't start...

KRAMER (moving back to the othe side of the booth): You're wasting your life.

GEORGE: I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!

KRAMER: O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: You got money?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Do you have a woman?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Do you have any prospects?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: You got anything on the horizon?

GEORGE: Uh...no.

KRAMER: Do you have any action at all?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?

GEORGE: I like to get the Daily News!

KRAMER: George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.

GEORGE: Why?

KRAMER: I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.

GEORGE: Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.

KRAMER: No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.

GEORGE: "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!

KRAMER: I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?

GEORGE: Uh, no, I'm not.

KRAMER: Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)

GEORGE: You're not really gonna go to California, are you?

KRAMER (points to his head): Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)


[Elaine's apartment at night. George is picking up his spare keys from Elaine.]

GEORGE: Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.

ELAINE: Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?

GEORGE: I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."

ELAINE: That's ridiculous.

GEORGE (shakes huge keyring): That's Kramer.

ELAINE: I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.

GEORGE: What for?

ELAINE: 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.

GEORGE: Jerry? Why?

ELAINE: 'Cause he gave me his.

GEORGE: So what?

ELAINE: So, if he has my keys, I should have his.

GEORGE: Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.

ELAINE: I just said the same thing to you.

GEORGE: What?

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?

ELAINE: Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.


[Jerry's apartment the next day.]

JERRY: Did you bring the keys?

GEORGE: Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.

JERRY: This could be an emergency!

GEORGE: You never should have taken away his keys!

JERRY: I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)

GEORGE: How'd the Mets do?

JERRY: They lost.

(Jerry and George open Kramer's door and poke their heads in.)

JERRY: Kramer?

(Newman walks up behind them.)

NEWMAN (startling them): Hello, boys.

JERRY: Hello, Newman.

NEWMAN: You lookin' for someone?

JERRY: Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!

NEWMAN: Coy? I'm not being coy.

JERRY (to George): Is he being coy?

GEORGE: Yeah, coy.

JERRY: You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?

NEWMAN (coyly): Who?

JERRY: Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!

NEWMAN: Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.

JERRY: Turn around, George.

GEORGE: Sure. (Turns around.)

NEWMAN: George?

JERRY: Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)

NEWMAN: Help! Help!

JERRY: Where's Kramer?

NEWMAN: HELP! (Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: What's going on?

(Newman grabs Elaine and hides behind her.)

NEWMAN: They're gonna beat me up!

GEORGE: No we're not.

JERRY: We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.

NEWMAN: You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.

JERRY: Bad rap?

NEWMAN: Yeah. From you.

JERRY: Me?

NEWMAN: You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.

JERRY: L.A.?


[Cut to Kramer in his car on the highway, listening to rock music. The car's engine starts to fail, then stalls. Kramer can't believe it.]


[Jerry's apartment at night]

(Jerry's at the window, George and Elaine are on the couch ).

JERRY: I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.

JERRY: Huh?

ELAINE: What...?

JERRY: No, what'd you say?

ELAINE: Nothing. I didn't say anything.

JERRY: Oh, you didn't see it.

ELAINE: Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.

JERRY: I heard you say something, there.

ELAINE: I didn't say anything.

JERRY: I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!

GEORGE: Ask her about Kramer.

JERRY: She's drunk out of her mind.


[Cut back to Kramer with his car broken down on the side of the highway. He tries to thumb a ride.]

 
Jerry approaching his apartment door. He tries to unlock it, but realizes Elaine has his keys. Jerry goes to the coffee shop to call Elaine.]

JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine): Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.

 
[Kramer's managed to hitch a ride on the back of a motorcycle.]

KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine): Hey! You ever been in an accident?

BIKER: About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)

 
[Jerry in a booth at the coffee shop waiting for George. George enters, spare keys in hand.]

JERRY (applauding): Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.

GEORGE: Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.

JERRY: Don't feel right? What are you talking about?

GEORGE: Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?

JERRY: What is the big deal?

GEORGE: Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.

JERRY: First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.

GEORGE: Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.

JERRY: Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)

GEORGE: Nope, no can do.

JERRY: George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!

GEORGE: Do you wanna fight?

JERRY: Do you wanna fight?

GEORGE: I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)

 
[Kramer's managed to hitch another ride, this time with a van full of drugged-out hippies. Kramer is telling them a story as they go down the road... ]

KRAMER: And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.

HIPPIE #1: Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.

KRAMER: Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.

HIPPIE #1: Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?

KRAMER: Oh, he's cold.

HIPPIE #1: Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!

HIPPIE #1: Hey, what's the rush, man?

KRAMER: Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.

HIPPIE #1: Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?

KRAMER: What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)

HIPPIE #2: Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)

 
[Elaine's building at night. Jerry and George approach Elaine's door, still arguing about the keys.]

JERRY: Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.

GEORGE: You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.

JERRY: What's that?

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: I heard something.

GEORGE: Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)

 
[Kramer's managed to hitch yet another ride, this time with a woman driving an eighteen-wheeler.]

KRAMER: So, how long you been drivin' this thing?

WOMAN: Goin' on four years.

KRAMER: Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.

WOMAN: Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.

KRAMER: You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.

WOMAN: You want to give it a try?

KRAMER: Really?

WOMAN: Do you know how to double-clutch?

KRAMER: Yeah.

WOMAN: Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)

 
[Jerry and George in Elaine's apartment looking for Jerry's spare keys.]

GEORGE: They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!

JERRY: Well, this is great.

GEORGE: Well, what do they look like?

JERRY: They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."

GEORGE: Well, they're obviously not here.

JERRY: Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.

GEORGE: Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!

JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk): What is this? "Murphy Brown"?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: By Elaine Benes?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?

GEORGE: Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)

JERRY: Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)

GEORGE: Gimme half!

JERRY: All right, here!

GEORGE: Why didn't she tell us?

JERRY (making fun): Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)

ELAINE: You weasels!

JERRY: What? What?

ELAINE: How dare you!

GEORGE: We hardly read anything!

JERRY: It was funny!

ELAINE: Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?

JERRY: Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...

ELAINE (grabs the papers from Jerry): Well, it's just a first draft!

JERRY: I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.

ELAINE (turning on George): Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)

GEORGE: He forced me to!

JERRY: I did not!

GEORGE: Yes you did!

ELAINE: You! Get out! Get out! Get out!

JERRY: Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!

ELAINE: Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!

JERRY: Good!

ELAINE (to George): And I want my keys back from you!

GEORGE: What, you don't want me to hold your keys?

ELAINE: No, you can't be trusted!

GEORGE: Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)

JERRY (to Elaine): And I don't want you to hold mine!

ELAINE: Good! I won't!

JERRY: Good! Don't! Are these my keys?

ELAINE: These aren't my keys!

GEORGE: Whose are these?

ELAINE: I don't know!

(Meanwhile, Kramer's finally made it to Los Angeles. He's shown roller-skating through traffic, and nearly running over some guy on a scooter.)

 
[Jerry and Elaine watching "Murphy Brown" in Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: I just thought I could write it.

JERRY: Is that something you want to do?

ELAINE: I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.

JERRY: Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.

ELAINE: O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.

JERRY: What did you say?

ELAINE: I didn't say anything.

JERRY: I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!

ELAINE (laughing): Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!

JERRY: Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!


[Cut to the screen of Jerry's TV.]

CANDICE BERGEN: Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.

KRAMER: Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.

CANDICE BERGEN: And you are...?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.

CANDICE BERGEN: Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.

KRAMER: Steven.

CANDICE BERGEN: Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?

KRAMER: Oh - I'm familiar with it.

CANDICE BERGEN: Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.)

(Episode ends with Kramer typing rapidly on his keyboard as he takes a bite out of a donut.)

There are many different job in the police. It seems to me, that the chalk outline guy is one of the better jobs that you can get. You know it's not dangerous, the criminals are long gone, that seems like a good one. I don't know who they are, I guess they're people who wanted to be a sketch artists, but they couldn't draw too well..."listen Johnson, forget the sketches. Do you think if we left a dead body right there on the sidewalk, you could manage to trace around it? Could you do that?". I don't even know how it helps to solve the crime? You know, they look at the thing on the ground..."aah his arm was like that when he hit the pavement. That means the killer must've been Jim."


[OPENING SCENE]

(GEORGE AND JERRY ARE IN A CAR. GEORGE IS GRABBING JERRY'S ARM)

GEORGE: He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!

JERRY: Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!

GEORGE: What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?

JERRY: Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.

GEORGE: Hope he's not the guy.

JERRY: Couldn't be the guy...nah.

GEORGE: God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.

JERRY: How can you think of food at the time like this?

GEORGE: Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.

JERRY: I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!

GEORGE: I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.

JERRY: You should've had some eggs.

GEORGE: For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?

JERRY: Have you ever heard of egg salad?

GEORGE: Why didn't you say something then?

JERRY: I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?

GEORGE: I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.

JERRY: I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.

GEORGE: Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.


[CUT TO KRAMER SINGING IN A SHOWER FOLLOWED BY A FALLING SOUND]


[BACK TO GEORGE AND JERRY ON THE STREET]

JERRY: I don't have any change. You've got any change?

GEORGE: No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.

JERRY: Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.

GEORGE: I have a ten.

JERRY: So, break it.

GEORGE: I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.

JERRY: So, buy something.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.

GEORGE: Breath problem?

JERRY: No, I just want some change.

GEORGE: Tell me.

JERRY: Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.

GEORGE: You know, I haven't eaten anything.

JERRY: I just wanna call the police!

GEORGE: Why don't you just call 911?

JERRY: But is this an emergency?

GEORGE: Of course it is.

JERRY: How is this an emergency?

GEORGE: Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.

JERRY: All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...

GEORGE: What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!

JERRY: Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?

GEORGE: What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?

JERRY: Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: You think so?

JERRY: Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.

GEORGE: Excuse me, where are we?

MAN: Earth.

JERRY: Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.

GEORGE: Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?

WOMAN: I don't know.

GEORGE: You don't know?

WOMAN: I don't know.

GEORGE: How come you don't know what street are you on?

WOMAN: You don't know.

JERRY: George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.

(Police car rolls by the sidewalk and stops. The police listens their conversation.)

GEORGE: Black and white?

JERRY: A cop car.

GEORGE: Why didn't you just say that?

JERRY: I thought it sounded kind of cool.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.

JERRY: Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.

GEORGE: I'll bet you, how much?

JERRY: Her tip.

GEORGE: You've got a bet.

JERRY: Ok.

GEORGE: How much do you tip a chamber maid?

POLICE: Which one of you is Costanza?

(Jerry and George point at each other.)

POLICE: Get in.

GEORGE: Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...


[KRAMER IS SHAVING. HE SNEEZES AND GETS SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR]


[BACK TO THE POLICE CAR WITH JERRY, GEORGE AND TWO COPS]

GEORGE: Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.

(JERRY SEARCHES FOR THE HANDLE, BUT CAN'T FIND ONE)

JERRY: Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.

COP: Cut it up back there.

GEORGE: He started it.

JERRY: I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?

COP: I don't think so.

JERRY: But you could?

COP: Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.

COP 2: We could drive on the wrong side of the road.

COP: Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.

COP 2: Shoot people...

GEORGE: You guys ever shot anybody?

COPS: No...

GEORGE: Hey, can I flip on the siren?

JERRY: Why are you bothering them for?

GEORGE: I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.

COP: Yeah, go ahead.

(GEORGE TRIES THE SIREN)

GEORGE: Wohoo, check it out.

JERRY: Can I try it?

COP: Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.

(JERRY TRIES THE SIREN)

JERRY: Scared the hell out of that guy.

GEORGE: You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?

JERRY: Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...

JERRY and GEORGE: Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...

COP: Hey!


[KRAMER IS COMBING HIS HAIR. TRYING TO GET THE COMB THROUGH.]

KRAMER: I'm dizzy.


[BACK TO THE POLICE CAR]

JERRY: Nice shotgun.

COP: Thanks.

JERRY: Clean as a whistle.

GEORGE: You could eat of that shotgun.

JERRY: What is that, a 12 gauge?

COP: Yeah.

JERRY: 12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.

GEORGE: My favorite.

JERRY: Mine too, love the 12 gauge.

GEORGE: Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.

COP: What do got over there?

COP 2: I don't know.

COP: Looks like a possible 5-19.

JERRY: 5-19? What's a 5-19?

GEORGE: Where?

COP 2: Think so?

COP: Looks like it.

JERRY: I can't believe this. A 5-19?

GEORGE: Where, where? I can't see.

COP: This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.

COP 2: All right, let's pull over and check it out.

JERRY: Pull over? You can't pull over.

GEORGE: What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?

JERRY: Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.

GEORGE: Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.

JERRY: We have an appointment!

GEORGE: What are you doing?!

JERRY: Great.

(COPS GO TO ARREST A GUY FOR TRYING TO STEAL A CAR)

GEORGE: There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.

JERRY: Which flavor?

GEORGE: Milano.

JERRY: Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?

GEORGE: Should I take some?

JERRY: I think that's a 5-19.

GEORGE: I'm starving...

(GEORGE REACHES FOR THE COOKIES AND THE COPS SLAM A GUY ON THE HOOD AND GEORGE BACKS AWAY)

JERRY: They're busting this guy.

GEORGE: They're cuffing him.

JERRY: I can't believe this.

(GEORGE GET CLOSER TO JERRY AND THEY THROW THE GUY NEXT TO GEORGE)


[MIDDLE MONOLOGUE]

I can't believe that cops still have to read that whole "you have the right to remain silence"-speech to every criminal they arrest. I mean is there anybody who doesn't know that by now? Can't they just go "Freeze, you're under arrest. You've ever seen Baretta? Yeah, good, get in the car."


[BACK TO POLICE CAR]

GEORGE: Hi.

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.

GEORGE: George, how you doing?

(GEORGE OFFERS HIS HAND, BUT THE GUY IS IN CUFFS)

GUY: What did you do?

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: Nothing.

GUY: Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing!

COP: Shut up.

JERRY: Hot out.

GUY: Brutal.

GEORGE: What do you tip a chamber maid.

GUY: I don't know, five bucks a night.

JERRY: No, a dollar, two tops.

GUY: Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks?

GEORGE: Narks?

JERRY: Imagine, us narks?

GEORGE: No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.

GUY: Really? Well, that's very nice.

GEORGE: Oh, thank you.

JERRY: Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.

GEORGE: Yeah well, we don't think.

JERRY: We're pretty sure.

GUY: A dollar a night?

JERRY: Yeah, that's a good tip!

GUY: That stinks!

JERRY: I read it in Ann Landers.

GUY: Oh, Ann Landers sucks!

COP 2: Hey, shut it up back there.

POLICE RADIO: Attention all units, attention all units, all units code 3. All units in the area, code 3 in progress, 1648 North Bartholis, units required for assistance in apprehension of 702.

COP: That's smog strangler.

JERRY: Kramer.

COP 2: Got him. Let's go.

(POLICE CAR COMES TO THE SCENE. JERRY OPENS THE BACK DOOR THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THEY GO AFTER THE COPS)

JERRY: I wanna see what's happening.

GEORGE: I don't know why I'm doing this.

LT MARTEL KNOCKS ON A DOOR AND KRAMER OPENS

KRAMER: Jerry, George!

LT. MARTEL: You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang.

(THE CAR THIEVE GUY RUNS AWAY FROM THE DOOR THAT JERRY AND GEORGE LEFT OPEN)


[KRAMER IS RUSHED THROUGH A GROUP OF PRESS]

REPORTERS: Why did you do it? What possessed you?

KRAMER: I don't know...


[COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES CENTRAL JAIL]

(JERRY AND GEORGE ARE VISITING KRAMER)

KRAMER: Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!

JERRY: We're doing fine. How are you?

KRAMER: What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.

GEORGE: A player?

KRAMER: Yeah, a player...

JERRY: Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?

KRAMER: What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.

JERRY: Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!

KRAMER: So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?

JERRY: Well, yeah...sure.

POLICE: Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you.

KRAMER: Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?

(KRAMER GOES WITH THE POLICE OFFICER, BUT ASKS IF HE COULD SAY JUST ONE MORE THING)

KRAMER: Help me!! Help me!

(OFFICER DRAGS KRAMER AWAY)


[KRAMER IS BEEN INTERROGATED BY LT. MARTEL]

KRAMER: I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!

LT. MARTEL: Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?

KRAMER: You're making a big mistake.

LT. MARTEL: No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay.

KRAMER: What?

LT. MARTEL: Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again.

KRAMER: Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!

LT. MARTEL: Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.

KRAMER: Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...

LT. MARTEL: I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory you're a weed.

KRAMER: No...

LT. MARTEL: Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.

(KRAMER SOBS)

LT. MARTEL: You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?

(KRAMER CRIES)

LT. MARTEL: You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?

(PHONE RINGS)

OFFICER: Lieutenant, it's for you.

LT. MARTEL: Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah.

(KRAMER KEEPS CRYING)

OFFICER: What it is, Lieutenant?

LT. MARTEL: Let him go.

OFFICER: What, but Lieutenant?

LT. MARTEL: You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight.

KRAMER: Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?

LT. MARTEL: I said beat it!


[JERRY AND GEORGE ARE WAITING OUTSIDE OF THE JAIL]

(KRAMER WALKS OUT)

KRAMER: Hahaa!

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: What happened?

KRAMER: Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.

JERRY: Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!

GEORGE: You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?

JERRY: While you were in jail. So you're free.

KRAMER: Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!

(THEY ALL DANCE A FEW STEPS AND THEN AS A POLICE GOES BY THEY LEAVE QUIETLY)


[KRAMER, JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HILLS OF L.A.]

JERRY: So Kramer, what are you going to do?

KRAMER: Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.

GEORGE: Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?

KRAMER: What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?

GEORGE: I'd like to hear that.

JERRY: Yeah...

KRAMER: Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...

JERRY: Kramer, she was murdered!

KRAMER: Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.

GEORGE: As a suspect in a serial killing.

KRAMER: Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.

GEORGE: What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.

JERRY: So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?

KRAMER: No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.

GEORGE: Taste this, is this a dill?

JERRY: No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.

KRAMER: Ok, it's forgotten.

GEORGE: Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.

JERRY: Well, take it easy.

KRAMER: Yeah, ok.

GEORGE: Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.

KRAMER: Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...

JERRY: Oh, no...

GEORGE: No, you're crushing my sandwich.


[JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HOTEL. GEORGE IS KICKING THE TUCKED COVERS.]

JERRY: Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.


[BACK TO JERRY'S APARTMENT. GEORGE AND JERRY ARE WATCHING TV. ]

GEORGE: Mint?

JERRY: No thanks.

GEORGE: I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.

JERRY: It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.

GEORGE: Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?

JERRY: No, I don't.

GEORGE: You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.

JERRY: Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.

GEORGE: I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.

JERRY: How much did you wound up tipping her?

GEORGE: Oh my God, I forgot!

JERRY: Well, communism didn't work.

(KRAMER WALKS IN)

KRAMER: Hey!

(KRAMER GOES TO THE FRIDGE)

KRAMER: Any mustard? This is empty.

JERRY: Yeah, there's a new one in there.

KRAMER: No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?

JERRY: Help yourself.

KRAMER: Yeah, all right.

GEORGE: Kramer, what are you doing here?

KRAMER: Getting something to eat.

JERRY: Kramer, here!

(JERRY THROWS THE APARTMENT KEYS TO KRAMER. KRAMER WALKS OUT AND COMES BACK WITH HIS KEYS. HE THROWS THEM TO THE TABLE KNOCKING JERRY'S SODA.)


[ACTION NEWS. KEITH MORRISON.]

Newscaster: Authorities exposed today, that the latest suspect in the smog strangling was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge, but somehow managed to escape from the police car, in which he was being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is also wanted in connection with a series of unrelated slains in the North West is still at large, his whereabouts unknown. He's described as 5'5" bald and reputedly a very generous tipper.


[CLOSING MONOLOGUE]

The thing about L.A. to me, that kind of threw me, was when they have these smog alerts out there and they actually recommend that people stay indoors during the smog alert. Now, maybe I'm way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is? I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar with couple of holes punched in the top? What the hell is going on out there? It's very strange, do you realize that it's now possible for parents to say to their children "All right kids, I want you in the house and get some fresh air! Summer vacation, everybody indoors."

It's amazing to me that people will move thousands of miles away to another city, they think nothing of it. They get on a plane, boom. They're there, they live there now. Just, uh, I'm living over there. You know, pioneers, it took years to cross the country. Now, people will move thousands of miles just for one season. I don't think any pioneers did that, you know. Yeah, it took us a decade to get there, and, uh, we stayed for the summer, it was nice, we had a pool, the kids loved it, and then we left about ten years ago and we just got back. We had a great summer, it took us 20 years and now our lives are over.


[George and Jerry enter Monk's Coffee Shop.]

GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Murphy Brown, the TV show.

JERRY: C'mon, will ya?

GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!

JERRY: Something, isn't it?

GEORGE: With Candace Bergen!

JERRY: I know!

GEORGE: I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: Did she show her breasts in that?

JERRY: She's not really the naked type.

GEORGE: I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.

JERRY: He did?

GEORGE: Yeah, I turned him down.

JERRY: How come you didn't tell me?

GEORGE: He asked me to keep it a secret.

JERRY: But you can never keep a secret.

GEORGE: I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.

JERRY: Well, you've come a long way.

GEORGE: I've matured.

JERRY: Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?

GEORGE: A free ticket?

JERRY: Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.

GEORGE: What about accommodations?

JERRY: All taken care of.

GEORGE: Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...


[Kramer, backstage, talking to some aspiring young actors.]

KRAMER: So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.

STUDIO GUARD: Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?

KRAMER: Uh, did you?

STUDIO GUARD: C'mon, let's go.

KRAMER: Well, I was just--

STUDIO GUARD: Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go.

KRAMER: Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?


[Kramer's apartment building in LA. Singers and actors are heard practicing in the background. Kramer leaves his apartment and makes a call on the pay phone in the hall.]

VOICE: Murphy Brown.

KRAMER: Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.

VOICE: Who's calling please?

KRAMER: Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.

(Dial tone.)

KRAMER: Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.

(Helena, a neighbor, steps into the hallway.)

HELENA: Hello Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?

HELENA: I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?

KRAMER: Well, that's only uh, 58 years.

HELENA: It was a Three Stooges short, "Sappy Pappy." I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?

KRAMER: Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?

HELENA: No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.

KRAMER: Uh huh, right.

HELENA: But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.

KRAMER: Right.

HELENA: Moe hits Curly with an axe,

KRAMER: Uh huh.

HELENA: The Stooges catch the kidnappers,

KRAMER: Right.

HELENA: But it's too late.

KRAMER: Really.

HELENA: The baby's dead.

KRAMER: Really?

HELENA: The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.

KRAMER: Well I don't remember that part.

HELENA: I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.

HELENA: Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.

KRAMER: Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.

HELENA: Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?

KRAMER: Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?

HELENA: Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,

KRAMER: Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.

HELENA: I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!


[Jerry's apartment. George walks in with several stuffed suitcases and backpacks.]

JERRY: What is this?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?

GEORGE: I happen to dress based on mood.

JERRY: Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.

GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.

JERRY: (referring to George's outfit): And what mood is this.

GEORGE: This is Morning Mist.


[A murder scene. There's a body under a blanket and two Lieutenants are talking.]

LT. COLEMAN:: What do you figure, 20? 21?

LT. MARTEL:: Close enough.

LT. COLEMAN:: Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.

LT. MARTEL:: No ID?

LT. COLEMAN:: No ID.

LT. MARTEL:: No witnesses?

LT. COLEMAN:: Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.

LT. MARTEL:: She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.

LT. COLEMAN:: Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?

LT. MARTEL:: I don't know, but I don't like it.


[Jerry and George are at the airport, in line for the metal detector.]

JERRY: Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.

GEORGE: Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.

JERRY: Just go.

(George braces himself and walks through the detector.)

GEORGE: Heh he, I made it.

(Jerry walks through and the machine beeps.)

SECURITY GUARD: Empty your pockets please.

(Jerry empties his pockets and walks through again, the machine beeps again.)

SECURITY GUARD: Walk through again please.

(Jerry walks through, the machine beeps again.)

SECURITY GUARD: Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets?

JERRY: Anklets?

SECURITY GUARD: A lot of men wear anklets.

JERRY: Really?

SECURITY GUARD: Yeah.

OTHER SECURITY GUARD (to George): What do you have in your bag, sir?

GEORGE: My bag?

SECURITY GUARD: Step over here please.

JERRY: Over here?

OTHER SECURITY GUARD: Do you have a knife in the bag?

GEORGE: A knife?

OTHER SECURITY GUARD: Open the bag, please.

(George opens his bag, the other security guard begins rummaging.)

OTHER SECURITY GUARD: What's this?

GEORGE: Moisturizer?

OTHER SECURITY GUARD: For your wife?

GEORGE: No, I uh... I use it.

SECURITY GUARD: Spread your arms and legs please.

(The security guard begins waving a small beeping detector up and down Jerry's body.)

JERRY: (facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.

OTHER SECURITY GUARD: Have a good trip.

SECURITY GUARD: Alright, go ahead.

JERRY: That's it?

SECURITY GUARD: That's it.

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?

JERRY: I must have iron rich blood.

GEORGE: Here we go, LA.

JERRY: The Coast,

GEORGE: La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?

JERRY: Who said that?

GEORGE: I called it.

JERRY: Oh no.

GEORGE: What do you mean, oh no.


[Monologue, Jerry on stage.]

Seems to me that the closest thing we have to Royalty in America are the people that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't you hate these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, look out, cart people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. Oooh! It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people, Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're too fat, slow and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel. The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no animated pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?


[Stock photo of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Cut to a casting office. Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.

RECEPTIONIST: Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial?

KRAMER: Uh, let's see... well.

[Cut to a montage of Kramer in group auditions for the productions the receptionist mentioned.]


[Kramer and Chelsea, a woman he met in the horror movie audition, exit the
casting office.]

KRAMER: You scream good.

CHELSEA: You too.


[Kramer and Chelsea are seated at a restaurant table.]

CHELSEA: So, can I keep this treatment?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.

CHELSEA: 'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money.

KRAMER: Really.

CHELSEA: Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

KRAMER: Um-hm.

CHELSEA: What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...

KRAMER: Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.

CHELSEA: Big deal.

KRAMER: He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.

CHELSEA: Why are you breathing so hard?

KRAMER: Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?

(Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a table nearby.)

KRAMER: Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...

FRED SAVAGE: Thank you.

KRAMER: Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.

FRED: Thanks.

KRAMER: Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...

FRED: That's ok. Relax, relax.

KRAMER: Ok, but I got this...

(Kramer lifts his leg and places his foot on a low table and the table collapses.)

KRAMER: Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.

FRED (a little frightened and backing away towards the door): Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.

KRAMER: I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.

FRED: Yeah.

KRAMER: So I'd like to give it to you.

FRED: Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!

KRAMER: (bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.

(Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door. After he leaves, Kramer gives the rest of the patrons a thumbs-up.)


[George and Jerry are in their hotel room. Jerry's on the telephone.]

JERRY: Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?

GEORGE: Curly.

JERRY: Wavy.

GEORGE: What'd you ask me for?

JERRY: Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?

GEORGE: Nope.

JERRY: 'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?

GEORGE (from the bathroom): Hey, a shoe buffing machine!

JERRY: I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?

GEORGE: You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
lotion!

JERRY: About 6-3.

GEORGE: Ooh, a shower cap!

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

JERRY: Coming.

(George walks to the door wearing a shower cap.)

LUPE: Hello. I have more towels.

GEORGE: Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?

LUPE: Lupe.

GEORGE: Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?

LUPE: Oh Yes.

GEORGE: Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.

LUPE: Oh, yes, yes.

GEORGE: Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.

LUPE: Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.

GEORGE: Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?

LUPE: Oh yees, It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?

GEORGE: Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?

JERRY: Excuse me, what?

GEORGE: You want your blankets tucked in?

JERRY: What blankets?

GEORGE: When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.

JERRY: I don't know, whatever they do.

LUPE: I tuck in? Yes?

JERRY: Tuck in, tuck in.

GEORGE: Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.

LUPE: Okay.

GEORGE: Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.

JERRY: Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.

GEORGE (to Lupe): Two no-tucks.

JERRY: Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.

GEORGE: You just said you weren't tucking.

JERRY: I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.

GEORGE: Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?

JERRY: Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?

LUPE: Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.

JERRY: Oh, okay, thanks.

LUPE: Thank you.

GEORGE: Thank you.

LUPE: Bye-bye.

GEORGE: Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.

LUPE: Bye.

GEORGE: Bye-bye.

(Lupe exits.)

JERRY: I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.

GEORGE: Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.

JERRY: They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!

GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.

JERRY: Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.

GEORGE: Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?


[Cut to Jerry and George in the car, continuing their discussion.]

GEORGE: You shouldn't have tucked.

JERRY: I like it tucked.

GEORGE: Nobody tucks anymore.

(As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into his car and drives off, spilling dozens of 8"x10" publicity photos. A police office notices this and picks up one of the photos.)


[Another murder scene. A police officer pulls a blanket over the body's head, but we catch a glimpse of the dead girl; it's Chelsea, Kramer's friend from the auditions. The same two Lieutenants as before are just arriving.]

OFFICER: Hey, Lieutenant.

LT. MARTEL:: Yeah.

OFFICER: This was found on her person.

LT. MARTEL:: On her person? What kind of expression is that?

OFFICER: I don't know, sir. Police lingo.

LT. MARTEL:: Oh yeah? What's your name, son.

OFFICER: Ross.

LT. MARTEL:: Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?

OFFICER: Yes sir.

LT. MARTEL:: She's dead. Have you got that?

OFFICER: Yes sir.

LT. MARTEL:: Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.

OFFICER: Yes sir.

(The Lt. examines the evidence. It's a title page that says "The Keys" A movie treatment by Kramer. The paper is torn so that the space where Kramer's first name was is missing.)

LT. MARTEL:: I think we just caught a break.


[Jerry and George are at the NBC studio.]

GEORGE: This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: Might meet a celebrity.

JERRY: I can't believe she threw out my napkin.

GEORGE: What are you worried about, you know it.

JERRY: You gonna be alright here?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.

JERRY: Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.

GEORGE: Go, go, go, don't worry about it.

(Jerry leaves and Corbin Bernsen enters through a stage door. he stands near George, obviously waiting for someone.)

GEORGE: Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.

CORBIN BERNSEN: How ya doing?

GEORGE: Big fan! Big fan.

CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Hey, you grew a beard, huh?

CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.

GEORGE: Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.

CORBIN BERNSEN: Really.

(Flash forward to the middle of George's 'pitch'.)

GEORGE: ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.

CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?

GEORGE: Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.

CORBIN BERNSEN: So you killed the cat.

GEORGE: That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?

(Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.)

(Flash forward, George is now talking with George Wendt in the same hallway.)

GEORGE: I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.

GEORGE WENDT: Oh, of course not.

GEORGE: But really, it's enough with the bar already.

GEORGE WENDT: Yeah, well.

GEORGE: Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?

GEORGE WENDT: Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.

GEORGE: Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?

GEORGE WENDT: Well yeah, they do, heh heh.

GEORGE: What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.

GEORGE WENDT (checking his watch, obviously uncomfortable): Yeah, you oughta write one of those.

GEORGE: Yeah?

GEORGE WENDT: Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...

GEORGE: Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!

(Jerry walks up as George Wendt leaves hastily.)

JERRY: How's it going?

GEORGE: Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!

JERRY: You got toilet paper on your heel there.

(George looks down, Jerry walks away.)


[The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding.]

Announcer: It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.

(Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview.)

CORBIN BERNSEN: Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.

(Quick shot of the audience, everyone is laughing besides George.)


[Cut to a police station. Helena is being questioned by Lt. Martel.]

HELENA: He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.


[Cut back to the Tonight Show, George Wendt, mid-interview.]

GEORGE WENDT: It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.

(Another quick shot of the audience, again everyone is laughing besides George.)


[Cut back to the police station. One of the kids from the van Kramer hitched a ride to LA in (see "The Keys") known only as 'The Freak' is being questioned by the Lt.]

THE FREAK: So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?


[Cut back to the Tonight Show, Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt are talking between takes.]

GEORGE WENDT: The guy you talked to, what did he look like?

CORBIN BERNSEN: Short little bald guy with glasses.

GEORGE WENDT: Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.

CORBIN BERNSEN: It never ends, does it?

(Cut to Jerry, on stage, doing his routine.)

JERRY: So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.

(Quick shot of the audience, nobody is laughing.)

(Quick shot of an extremely uncomfortable Jerry.)


[Cut back to the police station. The Lt. is on the phone.]

LT. MARTEL: Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer.


[George and Jerry are leaving the Tonight Show set]

JERRY: I was terrible.

GEORGE: What are you, crazy? You were fine.

JERRY: Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...

GEORGE: Conveyor belt.

JERRY: Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.

GEORGE: I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?

JERRY: Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.

(George and Jerry walk past a TV and stop as a special report is being broadcast.)

TV NEWSCASTER: Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as "Kramer".

(George and Jerry stare at each other in disbelief.)


Closing monologue.

Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is left in the show. You know, they're always looking off camera, "Do we have time? Are we out of time? How we doin' on time? Anybody know what the time is? What's the time? Check the time?" You never see Magnum P.I. go, "Should I strangle this guy or are we gonna take a break here? Can you stay for another beating? I'll tell you what, I'll bop him in the head, we'll do a commercial, we'll come back, I'll drive in the car real fast, stay with us."

GEORGE: What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?

JERRY: Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?

GEORGE: All right, so what did they do?

JERRY: I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.

GEORGE: Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.

JERRY: Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .

STU: Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.

JERRY: Hi.

STU: Could we speak for a few moments?

JERRY: Sure.

JAY: Hi, Jay Crespi.

JERRY: Hello.

GEORGE: Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?

JAY: That's right.

GEORGE: I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.

JAY: Mm, I'm not-

JERRY: George-

GEORGE: (backing off) Huh? All right, fine.

STU: First of all, that was a terrific show.

JERRY: Oh thank you very much.

STU: And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.

JERRY: Really? Wow.

STU: So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.

JERRY: I'd be very interested in something like that.

STU: Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.

(They start to exit.)

JERRY: Okay. Great. Thanks.

STU: It was very nice meeting you.

JERRY: Thank you.

JAY: Nice meeting you.

JERRY: Nice meeting you.

(George returns)

GEORGE: What was that all about?

JERRY: They said they were interested in me.

GEORGE: For what?

JERRY: You know, a TV show.

GEORGE: Your own show?

JERRY: Yeah, I guess so.

GEORGE: They want you to do a TV show?

JERRY: Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.

GEORGE: Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.

JERRY: Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?

GEORGE: Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.

JERRY: But gymnastics is not for everybody.

GEORGE: I know, but he's your son.

JERRY: So what?

GEORGE: All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.

JERRY: Yeah and...?

GEORGE: And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.

JERRY: What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.

GEORGE: I know, but antiques are very popular right now.

JERRY: No they're not, they used to be.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, like you know.

JERRY: Oh like you do.


[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: ...And you're the manager of the circus.

JERRY: A circus?

KRAMER: Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.

JERRY: I don't think so.

KRAMER: Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.

JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it.

KRAMER: Why not?

JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."

NEWMAN:Kramer.

JERRY: Hello Newman.

NEWMAN: Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.

KRAMER: All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)

JERRY AND NEWMAN: Yeah, sure.

JERRY: What's this all about?

NEWMAN: We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.

JERRY: I didn't know you had a motorctcle.

NEWMAN: Well my girlfriend had one.

JERRY: You have a girlfriend?

NEWMAN: I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.

JERRY: I never remember you with a girl.

NEWMAN: Nevertheless, ...

JERRY: This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.

NEWMAN: Don't say anything.

JERRY: All right.

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: You know you're getting gypped over here.

KRAMER: Really, Ah,

NEWMAN: We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.

KRAMER: Oh, stop saying 'reneging".

NEWMAN: Well you're reneging.

KRAMER: I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.

(they try to exchange items but won't let go)

NEWMAN: All right give it to me. let go ...

KRAMER: You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)

JERRY: Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!

NEWMAN: Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)

JERRY: Does that thing work?

KRAMER: Nah.


[At Monks]

(Jerry and George enter.)

JERRY: ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.

GEORGE: I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.

GEORGE: So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?

JERRY: No, nothing.

GEORGE: Why don't they have salsa on the table?

JERRY: What do you need salsa for?

GEORGE: Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.

JERRY: You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"

GEORGE: You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."

JERRY: "Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"

GEORGE: See, this should be a show. This is the show.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: This. Just talking.

JERRY: (dismissing) Yeah, right.

GEORGE: I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.

JERRY: Just talking? Well what's the show about?

GEORGE: It's about nothing.

JERRY: No story?

GEORGE: No forget the story.

JERRY: You've got to have a story.

GEORGE: Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.

JERRY: And who is on the show? Who are the characters?

GEORGE: I could be a character.

JERRY: You?

GEORGE: Yeah. You could base a character on me.

JERRY: So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."

JERRY: And who else is on the show?

GEORGE: Elaine could be a character. Kramer..

JERRY: Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And it's about nothing?

GEORGE: Absolutely nothing.

JERRY: So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.

GEORGE: We go into NBC.

JERRY: "We"? Since when are you a writer?

GEORGE: (Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.

JERRY: You want to go with me to NBC?

GEORGE: Yeah. I think we really go something here.

JERRY: What do we got?

GEORGE: An idea.

JERRY: What idea?

GEORGE: An idea for the show.

JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is.

GEORGE: It's about nothing.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.

JERRY: So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.

GEORGE: Exactly.

JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."

GEORGE: There you go.

(A moment passes)

JERRY: (Nodding) I think you may have something there.


[Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's explaining George's idea to Kramer)

JERRY: So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.

KRAMER: (Thinks) No, I don't think so.

JERRY: What do you mean you don't think so?

KRAMER: I don't like it.

JERRY: I don't understand. What don't you like about it?

KRAMER: I don't like the idea of a character based on me.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: well it just doesn't sit well.

JERRY: You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.

KRAMER: That's your problem, buddy.

JERRY: I don't understand what the big deal is.

KRAMER: Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.

JERRY: Whatever you want.

KRAMER: I get to play Kramer.

JERRY: You can't play Kramer.

KRAMER: I am Kramer.

JERRY: But you can't act.

KRAMER: Phew!

(Newman enters)

JERRY: Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.

KRAMER: Newman?

NEWMAN:Use me for what?

JERRY: Nothin' What do you want?

NEWMAN:Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?

KRAMER: Yeah. That's strange.

NEWMAN:A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.

KRAMER: That's queer uh?

NEWMAN: I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.

KRAMER: Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.

NEWMAN:You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?

JERRY: Buyer beware.

NEWMAN:Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?

KRAMER: No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.

NEWMAN:No, but there's karma, Kramer.

JERRY: Karma Kramer?

NEWMAN:And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)


[NBC reception area]

(Jerry and George are waiting)

JERRY: (To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?

GEORGE: (Nervous) Nothing.

JERRY: You sure? You look a little pale.

GEORGE: No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.

JERRY: What, are you nervous?

GEORGE: No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.

JERRY: This was your idea!

GEORGE: What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.

JERRY: Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.

GEORGE: They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.

JERRY: I told you not to come.

GEORGE: I need some water. I gotta get some water.

JERRY: They'll give us water in there.

GEORGE: Really? That's pretty good.

(Jerry looks into hallway)

JERRY: Oh God, it's Joe Devola.

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.

JERRY: Oh God he saw me.

DEVOLA: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?

DEVOLA: You're under no obligation to shake my hand.

JERRY: Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.

DEVOLA: Why shouldn't I look good?

JERRY: Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?

DEVOLA: You want to hit me?

JERRY: What are you doing here?

DEVOLA: I dreopped a script off.

JERRY: AH, GOOD FOR YOU.

(they stare at each other)

JERRY: Well, ...

DEVOLA: You don't have to say anything.

JERRY: No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

DEVOLA: Why?

JERRY: Kramer's party.

DEVOLA: Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?

JERRY: No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.

DEVOLA: Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.

JERRY: No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.

(Crazy Joe leaves)

JERRY: Give my best to Hinckley.

GEORGE: What was that?

JERRY: I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...

(before he can dial)

RECEPTIONIST: They're ready for you.

GEORGE: Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?

JERRY: Relax. Who are they?

GEORGE: Yeah, they're not better than me.

JERRY: Course not.

GEORGE: Who are they?

JERRY: They're nobody.

GEORGE: What about me?

JERRY: What about you?

GEORGE: Why them? Why not me?

JERRY: Why not you?

GEORGE: I'm as good as them.

JERRY: Better.

GEORGE: You really think so?

JERRY: No.

(The door opens, and, from Jerry and George's point of view, four executives stand up)


[NBC president's office]

(Stu Chermak, Susan Ross, Jay Crespi, and Russell Dalrymple, the head of the network, are all talking with Jerry and George)

STU: (To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.

GEORGE: The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.

JERRY: Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

RUSSELL: What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?

GEORGE: (Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.

JERRY: Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?

GEORGE: Pepe.

JERRY: Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.

SUSAN: Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?

GEORGE: No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.

RUSSELL: So, what have you two come up with?

JERRY: Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-

GEORGE: (Interrupting) May I?

JERRY: Go ahead.

GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.

RUSSELL: Nothing?

GEORGE: (Smiling) Nothing.

RUSSELL: (Unimpressed) What does that mean?

GEORGE: The show is about nothing.

JERRY: (To George) Well, it's not about nothing.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.

JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.

(Jerry and George glare at each other. The receptionist enters)

RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.

RUSSELL: I'll call back.

(Receptionist leaves)

GEORGE:(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?

RUSSELL: (Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.

GEORGE: Is it with a "y"?

RUSSELL: No.

SUSAN: What's the premise?

JERRY: ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.

GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.

RUSSELL: You read? You read on the show?

JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.

RUSSELL: All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?

GEORGE: Oh, no. No stories.

RUSSELL: No stories? So, what is it?

GEORGE: (Showing an example) What'd you do today?

RUSSELL: I got up and came to work.

GEORGE: There's a show. That's a show.

RUSSELL: (Confused) How is that a show?

JERRY: Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.

GEORGE: No, no, no. Nothing happens.

JERRY: Well, something happens.

RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it?

GEORGE: Because it's on TV.

RUSSELL: (Threatening) Not yet.

GEORGE: Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?

(A moment passes)

JERRY: (To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..


[Monks]

JERRY: I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.

GEORGE: . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.

JERRY: Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?

GEORGE: Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.

JERRY: IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!

GEORGE: Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.

JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.

GEORGE: Wait a minute let me call Susan.

JERRY: No, no this is more important.

GEORGE: She might be leaving to work any minute.

JERRY: No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.

GEORGE: No.

(they race to the pay phone)


[Paris hotel room - Dr. Reston and Elaine are kissing]

ELAINE: What is it?

DR. RESTON: I was just thinking about this patient of mine.

ELAINE: What?

DR. RESTON: Just wondering if he's taking his medication.

ELAINE: Well, come on we're on vacation.


[Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)

KRAMER: Yeah (to buzzer)

GEORGE: (OC) It's George.

JERRY: And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.

KRAMER: Whoa, back up a second.

JERRY: Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.

KRAMER: Why would you think I would invite him?

JERRY: I just a ssumed, ...

KRAMER: Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.

(George and Susan enter)

GEORGE: Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.

JERRY: Of course. How are you?

SUSAN: Fine, it's good to see you.

GEORGE: And this is Kramer.

SUSAN: Hello.

GEORGE: All right go ahead Susan, tell him.

JERRY: Tell me what?

SUSAN: Well, I, (phone rings)

JERRY: Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.

TEL: Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.

JERRY: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.

TEL: Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.

JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.

TEL: No.

JERRY: Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)

GEORGE: Well, go ahead, tell him.

JERRY: Kramer, are you drinking that milk?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: What's the expiration date on that?

KRAMER: September third.

JERRY: The third?

GEORGE: and SUSAN: The third?

KRAMER: Um, Uh, ugh, ...

SUSAN: Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)


[Monk's]

GEORGE: I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.

JERRY: I think SHE saw it coming.

GEORGE: You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.

JERRY: Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.

GEORGE: What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.

JERRY: Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.

GEORGE: Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.

(Kramer enters with helmet)

JERRY: What happened to you?

KRAMER: Devola came after me.

JERRY: What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?

KRAMER: Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."

JERRY: Boy, that is some kick.

KRAMER: Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.

JERRY: Wow, Newman's helmet.

GEORGE: Holly.

KRAMER: I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.

JERRY: Me, why?

KRAMER: He doesn't like you.

JERRY: What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.

KRAMER: Pass the cream.

GEORGE: Wait a second. (smells it). all right.

[Jerry's apartment]

(Enter Kramer with one pant leg on)

JERRY: (going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?

KRAMER: What are you looking for?

JERRY: The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?

KRAMER: No, no, no.

(Jerry notices Kramer's look)

JERRY: All right, what is this?

KRAMER: (clueless) what is what?

JERRY: All right, very funny. I get it.

KRAMER: You're in a weird mood.

JERRY: Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.

KRAMER: Fix what?

JERRY: Your pants!

(Kramer is startled when he realizes his looks)

KRAMER: what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?

JERRY: Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?

KRAMER: No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?

JERRY: Go look at your face in the mirror.

KRAMER: Wha-huh-wha-huh...

(door buzzer)

JERRY: (pressing intercom) yeah?

GEORGE: (on intercom) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: I don't believe this.

JERRY: You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?

KRAMER: No, I swear.

JERRY: I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.

(Enter George)

GEORGE: (to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.

KRAMER: Me?

(George hands Kramer a paper)

GEORGE: Yeah, here you go.

KRAMER: What's this?

GEORGE: A dry-cleaning bill?

JERRY: From that woman at NBC?

GEORGE: Yeah.

KRAMER: A dry-cleaning bill for what?

GEORGE: For vomiting on her vest!

KRAMER: Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!

GEORGE: Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!

KRAMER: Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.

JERRY: (pointing Kramer) He drank it.

KRAMER: I didn't know.

JERRY: All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: How much was it to clean the vest?

GEORGE: Eighteen dollars.

JERRY: Can you get vomit out of suede?

GEORGE: I don't know.

KRAMER: Yo-yo Ma!

JERRY: What? Yo-yo Ma?

KRAMER: What about him?

JERRY: You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.

GEORGE: What's Yo-yo Ma?

JERRY: He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.

GEORGE: All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.

JERRY: I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.

GEORGE: I know!

JERRY: That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?

GEORGE: The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!

GEORGE: It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.

KRAMER: Jeez!

GEORGE: Anyway.

(Phone rings, Kramer picks up. Answers in Italian.)

JERRY: (interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.

GEORGE: They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?

JERRY: I don't know about sixty.

GEORGE: Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?

JERRY: Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?

GEORGE: I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'

JERRY: Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!

GEORGE: Oh!

JERRY: You know, I think he wears a piece.

GEORGE: Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.


[Street]

JERRY: I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.

(He throws his watch in the trash can beside him)

GEORGE: What, is that the one your parents gave you?

JERRY: Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.

GEORGE: All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.

JERRY: I'll pay for it.

GEORGE: It's not the money!

JERRY: Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?

(Both raise their arm to signal a cab.)

LEO: Jerry!

JERRY: Uncle Leo!

LEO: Helloooo!

JERRY: Hello there, how're you doing?

LEO: Ha ha! How are you?

JERRY: Good, good.

LEO: How's your mom and dad?

JERRY: Good, fine.

LEO: What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!

JERRY: Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.

LEO: You know where I just came from?

(He grabs Jerry's forearm.)

Danny Barma.

JERRY: (not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.

LEO: He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!

(Leo shakes Jerry around using his grip on Jerry's arm.)

JERRY: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.

(George gets impatient, touches his watch subtly, maybe subconsciously.)

LEO: The funny thing is: I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me: 'You need any pajamas?'

JERRY: (interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.

LEO: Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.

JERRY: We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.

LEO: Nobody got a gun to your head!

JERRY: (seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.

LEO: Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.

JERRY: I'm sorry, really.

LEO: You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!

JERRY: Sorry, really.

(Leo turns around and leaves. He passes by the trash can and sees the watch. He picks it up, takes it to his ear, laughs and puts it on. He walks away.)


[Hall out of Kramer's apartment]

(Newman knocks on Kramer's door)

KRAMER: (from inside) Yeah?

NEWMAN: Come on, are you ready? Let's go!

(Straightens his tie)

(Kramer opens the door. He has shaving cream on his face.)

KRAMER: For what?

NEWMAN: What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.

KRAMER: what about?

NEWMAN: The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.

KRAMER: I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.

NEWMAN: You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.

KRAMER: Well, I can't!

NEWMAN: Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!

KRAMER: Shut up! I'll get my coat!


[Newman enters Kramer's apartment]

KRAMER: Don't step on anything.


[NBC's waiting room]

JERRY: You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.

GEORGE: I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.

JERRY: You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go: 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'

GEORGE: Look at this.

JERRY: Why didn't you shave this morning?

GEORGE: 'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Because of the day before. It's a long story.

(Jerry looks down the hall.)

Can't get back on schedule.

JERRY: Is that Joe Davola?

(Jerry crouches in his seat)

GEORGE: It's not him!

JERRY: I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.

Receptionist: Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.

JERRY: Oh.

(They get up)

GEORGE: Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?

(They walk toward the office)

JERRY: All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.

GEORGE: Okay. A little.


[Courthouse waiting room]

NEWMAN: Okay, you're all set? You got your story?

KRAMER: No.

NEWMAN: When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.

KRAMER: Uhm...

NEWMAN: Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.

(Pause; they're thinking)

KRAMER: I never had an air conditioner.

NEWMAN: No! That's no reason to kill yourself!

KRAMER: Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?

NEWMAN: Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.

KRAMER: Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.

NEWMAN: No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.

KRAMER: I was never able to become a banker.

(Newman has a revelation.)

NEWMAN: Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.

NEWMAN: You must be banker.

KRAMER: MUST be banker.

NEWMAN (satisfied): Okay, we'll go with the banker story.


[NBC office]

(I might be missing a line here, I suck at cutting the commercials. If so, please complete.)

GEORGE: The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.

(George is the only one laughing)

RUSSEL: And people really have to care about the characters.

GEORGE: Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?

JERRY: Wouldn't tune in.

GEORGE: Would they tune in?

JERRY: No tune.

RUSSEL: We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.

GEORGE: The show will be like a heart attack!

JERRY: Just a huge massive coronary.

RUSSEL: So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.

GEORGE: Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.

JERRY: He couldn't believe it.

GEORGE: (Laughs, snorts) I said, I said: 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'

(Jerry and George laugh)


[Courtroom]

Police officer: Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.

JUDGE: And then what happened?

Police officer: Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream: 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'


[NBC office]

RUSSEL: Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.

(George starts, Jerry starts later, both speak at the same time, nonstop)

GEORGE: Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.

JERRY: We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.

GEORGE: Yeah!

Stu: Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?

(Pause. George and Jerry are puzzled.)

(Jerry gets it, pokes George.)

JERRY: Your off-Broadway play.

GEORGE: Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.

JERRY: (backs his story) Hmm, hmm.

GEORGE: That's my vow to you.

RUSSEL: Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.

(the lady is Susan)

(George and Jerry both speak at the same time, nonstop)

GEORGE: Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.

JERRY: Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.

RUSSEL: (gets up) So, let's make a pilot.

(Hand shakes)


[Courtroom]

NEWMAN: I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.

JUDGE: I don't understand.

NEWMAN: You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...

KRAMER: (interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!

NEWMAN: So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.

JUDGE: So then he didn't kill himself.

NEWMAN: No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today

(Stands up, points to Kramer.) (dramatically) sitting right over there! And he can corroborate my entire testimony.


[NBC's waiting room]

(Jerry and George are coming out of the office)

GEORGE: See?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!

JERRY: Now, all we gotta do is write it.

GEORGE: Yes! How're we gonna do that?

(Enter Susan)

SUSAN: Hey! Congratulations!

JERRY: Thanks.

GEORGE: Oh, thank you.

JERRY: Thank you, thanks.

GEORGE: Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.

SUSAN: No.

Receptionist: Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call.

JERRY: Phone call? Who knows I'm here?

(He picks up the phone)

Hello? Mom? How'd you know I was here? Oh, I was not rude to him, that is baloney! I couldn't talk! I couldn't talk! I had a meeting! I don't know... he-he went off on something about pajamas!

GEORGE: When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.

SUSAN: Oh, it was only vomit.

GEORGE: Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.

SUSAN: Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber: yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*

GEORGE: No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.

SUSAN: Well, it was eighteen dollars.

GEORGE: Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.

SUSAN: Yeah. Call me.

GEORGE: All right, great.

SUSAN: Bye.

JERRY: Bye thanks.

GEORGE: (chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: I offered to pay. She should've said no.

JERRY: She did, you insisted.

GEORGE: Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.

JERRY: Nah!

GEORGE: How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?

JERRY: oh, I d-I don't know. I d---

GEORGE: Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.

JERRY: Okay.

GEORGE: (excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.


[Coffee shop]

GEORGE: Thirteen thousand?

JERRY: Thirteen thousand.

GEORGE: a piece?

JERRY: No, for both!

GEORGE: That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.

JERRY: Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?

GEORGE: Well, he does.

JERRY: You're nuts!

GEORGE: I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?

JERRY: He's somebody.

GEORGE: What about me?

JERRY: You're nobody.

GEORGE: Why him? Why not me?

JERRY: He's good, you're not.

GEORGE: I'm better than him.

JERRY: You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!

GEORGE: (crouches too) What? Where? Where?

JERRY: Outside! I saw him outside!


[Europe]

(Elaine is kissing with a guy. He stops. She keeps kissing him, then stops.)

ELAINE: what is it?

BOYFRIEND: Oh, it's this patient.

ELAINE: (sighing) Again?

BOYFRIEND: I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.

ELAINE: Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.

BOYFRIEND: Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.

(Elaine turns around, rolls her eyes.)


[Coffee shop]

JERRY: Go outside and see if he's still there.

GEORGE: I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.

JERRY: Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.

(A cop sits down at the counter.)

GEORGE: Tell the cop.

JERRY: Good idea.

(Walks to counter)

Excuse me officer. There's a guy outside and he's kind of a nut job and I think he's waiting to beat me up. If you could just walk me outside and wait till I get into a cab.

COP: Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.

JERRY: Thanks.

(Jerry waits a while and realizes he has to go sit back with George and wait over there.)

JERRY: (back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.

(Looks over at the cop)

Hey! He's looking at the menu now. What's he looking at the menu for?!

GEORGE: I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.

(Jerry gets up and walks to the counter)

JERRY: (bossy) What are you doing?

COP: What?

JERRY: What, are you ordering food now?

COP: Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.

JERRY: What happened to the muffin?

COP: I got a little hungry.

JERRY: All of a sudden you get hungry?

COP: Yeah! You got a problem with that?

JERRY: No! Enjoy your lunch.

(Goes back toward the booth and stops.)

You know a muffin can be very filling.

(Keeps walking to the booth) (to George) He's getting a sandwich now!

GEORGE: I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.

JERRY: All of a sudden he gets hungry.

GEORGE: You know, a muffin can be very filling.

JERRY: I know!


[Courtroom]

NEWMAN: (interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?

KRAMER: What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?

NEWMAN: You know what I mean.

KRAMER: (to Judge) I was very upset that day.

NEWMAN: And why was that?

KRAMER: (to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!

NEWMAN: All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.

KRAMER: All right.

NEWMAN: Okay.

KRAMER: (to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.

NEWMAN: And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.

KRAMER: (not convincing) Uh, yeah.

NEWMAN: It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...

JUDGE: Mister Newman.

NEWMAN: Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.

JUDGE: Uh, continue.

NEWMAN: As you were saying, Mister Kramer...

KRAMER: What was the question?

NEWMAN: You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.

KRAMER: Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'

NEWMAN: But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?

KRAMER: I don't know.

NEWMAN: It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?

JUDGE: Uh, could you get to the speeding?

NEWMAN: Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?

KRAMER: (puzzled) Phone call?

NEWMAN: Yes, a phone call!

KRAMER: From who?

NEWMAN: From me!

KRAMER: From you?

NEWMAN: Yes, from me!! I called you remember?

KRAMER: You called me?

NEWMAN: Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?

KRAMER: what?

NEWMAN: You were going to...

(Mimmicks hanging himself, growing hysterical as only Newman can)

You were going to do something

(Mimmicks stabbing himself in stomach and jerking the knife around) to yourself! You were going to do something to yourself! Remember the banking? The banking, about the banking, about the banking!!!

JUDGE: I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---

NEWMAN: Yes, the banker!!!

KRAMER: What banking?

NEWMAN: A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...

JUDGE: That's enough already.

NEWMAN: Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.

KRAMER: I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!

NEWMAN: (to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.

JUDGE: That'll be seventy-five dollars.

NEWMAN: (Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!

(They fall on their backs. Kramer knocks the flag on judge.)


[Coffee shop]

JERRY: Do you see him?

GEORGE: I'm not* sure.

JERRY: Well, either you see him or you don't.

GEORGE: All right. I don't.

JERRY: (looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!

GEORGE: What's with this guy?

(Jerry walks to the counter)

JERRY: (still bossy) Did you just order coffee?

COP: Yeah.

JERRY: This is really too much.

COP: What is your problem?

JERRY: Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.

COP: Well, you're just gonna have to wait.

(Enter Kramer and Newman)

KRAMER: Never said anything about the banking.

NEWMAN: You're off your rocker.

JERRY: Hey you guys!

KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: What are you doing here?

KRAMER: What are YOU doing here?

JERRY: Hey, is Davola outside?

KRAMER: Davola?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: No, I didn't see him.

NEWMAN: Crazy Joe Davola?

GEORGE: (reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.

JERRY: Eleven dollars for what?

GEORGE: Muffin, sandwich and coffee!

JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.

KRAMER: You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?

JERRY: No.

NEWMAN: Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?

GEORGE: What's the difference? The money is not important.

JERRY: (looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?

NEWMAN: Yeah.

JERRY: I think you're getting a ticket.

NEWMAN: Deh!

KRAMER: Run, run! Go, go, go!

(Newman runs outside)

NEWMAN: Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.

KRAMER: I saw the whole thing!

JERRY: Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.

GEORGE: Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.

JERRY: Oh, like you know what you're talking about!

GEORGE: No, YOU do!

My parents had two constant arguments, while ah, they were driving, over either how fast my father was going, or how much gas was left in the tank.  My father had a standard defense for either one of these, it was always, that's because you're looking at it from an angle.  If you were over here -- it looks from where you're sitting, it looks like I'm doing 90 on empty... but that's because you're over there.  If you were over here you'd know I'm in the driveway with a full tank.?  (makes the steering wheel motion with hands)
 


[In Jerry's Car]

JERRY: So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.

HELEN: And they liked the idea?

JERRY: Yeah.

MORTY: What'ya got leather seats here?

HELEN: Since when is George a writer?

JERRY: What writer? It's a sitcom.

HELEN: This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?

JERRY: Soon, there's a couple of problems.

MORTY: Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.

JERRY: What do you expect? It's airline food.

MORTY: They give you that *Fish.*

JERRY: How could you eat fish on a plane?

MORTY: because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.

HELEN: What kind of problems?

JERRY: Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.

HELEN: What? He's not even working.

MORTY: George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.

HELEN: Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.

JERRY: We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
 
 

[George's car]

GEORGE: So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.

SUSAN: Yu - you're passing?

GEORGE: Well, it's . . . much too low.

SUSAN: Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?

GEORGE: tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.

SUSAN: Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.

GEORGE: Standard?

SUSAN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Is Ted Danson's deal standard?

SUSAN: Ted Danson?

GEORGE: You know, the guy from Cheers.

SUSAN: Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.

GEORGE: I didn't say I was Ted Danson.

SUSAN: All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.

GEORGE: You tell Russell.

SUSAN: Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.

GEORGE: Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?

SUSAN: Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.

GEORGE: Well what would I say in the note?

SUSAN: Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.

GEORGE: Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
 
 

[Jerry's car at gas station]

HELEN: Were you waiting long at the gate?

JERRY: Um, I don't even know?

HELEN: Where's that watch we bought you?

JERRY: Oh uh ...

(Flashback to street)

JERRY: That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)

GEORGE: Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?

JERRY: Yeah, but it never works.

(Back to present day in car at gas station)

JERRY: . . . it's uh, being fixed.

MORTY: I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.

JERRY: It's at the jeweler.

MORTY: You send me the bill.

JERRY: I'm not sending you the bill.

HELEN: That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.

GAS STATION ATTENDANT: That's uh, $18.50.

MORTY: Here, I got it.

JERRY: What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.

MORTY: No, no put it away . . .

JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: Stop it.

JERRY: I have money. I make money.

MORTY: Yeah, yeah, you make money.

JERRY: You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?

HELEN: No, I don't think that.

JERRY: Yes you do. That's what you both think.

MORTY: I'm paying.

JERRY: Dad I'm paying.

MORTY: Get out of here.

JERRY: You're not paying.

(both fighting to pay - trying to hand cash out the window)

MORTY: Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father.  Over my dead body Jerry.  I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.

JERRY: No don't do this.  You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
 
 

[Jerry's apartment -- Jerry is carrying two suitcases, Morty carries one]

JERRY: Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?

MORTY: Nothing nothing.

JERRY: Leave it. What about your back?

HELEN: Morty, what are you doing?

MORTY: All right, all right.

JERRY: You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.

(Kramer enters -- he has a bandage on his left temple)

KRAMER: Hey, Morty.

MORTY: Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.

KRAMER: Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi

HELEN: Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?

KRAMER: Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.

HELEN: What guy?

KRAMER: Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola.

HELEN: Why?

KRAMER: Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.

JERRY: Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?

JERRY: I didn't know he wasn't invited.

MORTY: Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?

HELEN: So why did you say anything?

JERRY: It was a mistake.

MORTY: They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.

HELEN: Are you okay?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion

HELEN: So what's the matter with this Devola guy?

JERRY: He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now.

JERRY: Kramer!!

HELEN: He's what?!

JERRY: He's joking.

HELEN: He's after you?

JERRY: Nooo.

HELEN: Why is he after you?

JERRY: He's not after me.

HELEN: Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.

MORTY: I'll make a few phone calls.

JERRY: Who you gonna to call?

MORTY: What are you worried about?

HELEN: I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.

JERRY: I didn't do anything.

HELEN: Well you must have done something.

JERRY: No, he just doesn't like me.

HELEN: Doesn't like you?  How could anyone not like you?

JERRY: You know it seems impossible.

HELEN: Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?

JERRY: Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.

HELEN: Huh, Jerry, don't say that.

JERRY: It's true.

HELEN: No, it isn't!  it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?

MORTY: Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.

HELEN: Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?

JERRY: Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.

KRAMER: When you getting it back?

JERRY: Uh, next week.

KRAMER: Next week? How come it's takin' so long?

JERRY: Huh?

KRAMER: I said how come it's takin' so long?

JERRY: I don't know. They're, backed up.

KRAMER: Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?

JERRY: Where'd I take it?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board)  Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?

KRAMER: What? Jimmy Sherman?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.

JERRY: No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.

KRAMER: No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.

JERRY: I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.

KRAMER: Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.

MORTY: Bring me the receipt.

KRAMER: I get that too. (exits)

JERRY: Be right back. (follows Kramer out)



[In the hallway]

(Jerry hits Kramer on the back as he is going in to his apartment.  Kramer spits out some Pepsi as he spins around to talk with Jerry.)

JERRY: There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it.  So don't mention it again, okay!

KRAMER: Y-Yeah, all right.

JERRY: All right.

KRAMER: Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)

(Jerry re-enters his own apartment)

HELEN: What was that about?

KRAMER: Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.

HELEN: How can anyone not like him.
 
 

[Back at the doctor's office]

MORTY: Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.

RECEPTIONIST: Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill this out.

(she hands him a clip board with some forms)

MORTY: All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.

RECEPTIONIST: I know. It's very long.

MORTY: Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.

HELEN: Well, it's not the sofa.

MORTY: You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.

HELEN: We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.

MORTY: Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued.  I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.

HELEN: Leo says he's the best there is.

MORTY: Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!

HELEN: Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?

MORTY: Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.

RECEPTIONIST: Julie, you want to take him back?
 
 

[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: You what? You passed? How could you do that?

GEORGE: ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so naïve. You are so, so naïve. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating.  Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.

JERRY: Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.

GEORGE: Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.

JERRY: We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?

GEORGE: Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!

JERRY: Well, I think you're wrong.

GEORGE: Well, we'll just see.

JERRY: Yes we will.

GEORGE: Yes we will.

JERRY: I just said that.

GEORGE: I know you did.

JERRY: So good for you.

GEORGE: So good for you.
 
JERRY: What are you repeating everything I'm saying?

GEORGE: What are you repeating everything I'm saying?

JERRY: Well George is an idiot.

GEORGE: Well George . . . .
 
 

[Doctor's examination room]

MORTY: All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.

HELEN: (enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.

MORTY: Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.

HELEN: Well the doctor must be busy.

MORTY: Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.

(a nurse walks in the room)

NURSE: Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.

MORTY: I thought you forgot about me.

NURSE: We didn't forget.

(pulls apart the Velcro blood pressure band)

MORTY: HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.

NURSE: Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays.

MORTY: Leave all my stuff here?

NURSE: Leave it.

(They exit)
 
 

[Jerry's Apartment]

GEORGE: Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.

JERRY: No I don't want ?em.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?

GEORGE: Here you go.

KRAMER: Cigars? (hits the box)

GEORGE: Yeah, Cubans.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah?

GEORGE: Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.

KRAMER: Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)

(Kramer puts a cigar in his mouth then goes and sits at the table -- George gets a jar of peanut butter from the fridge and stands at the kitchen counter opening it.)

(Intercom Buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah?

VOICE: Federal Express.

JERRY: Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.

KRAMER: Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.

JERRY: You think so?

KRAMER: Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.

JERRY: So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.

KRAMER: Yes. It's dangerous.

(Knock on the door)

KRAMER: wait det doit ... dit  (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)

JERRY: Who is it?

Voice: Federal Express.

KRAMER: Okay, ... gidg gi gt  (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)

(Jerry opens the door -- it's Elaine)

ALL: Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

(Lots of running in place from Jerry, Elaine and George -- with joy and excitement and hands clapping - Elaine jumps into Jerry's arms and hugs him, then turns to George and gives him a big hug with pats on the back -- then turns to Kramer and hugs him.)

KRAMER: I want one of those!

ELAINE: Hiiii Kramer

KRAMER: Oh yes

ELAINE: Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.

KRAMER: Well I came back for you.

ELAINE: Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)

JERRY: I missed you.

ELAINE: Really? You really missed me?

JERRY: Yeah, . . . seriously.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.

JERRY: Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)

ELAINE: Ahhhhhh haa ha ha

KRAMER: Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.

ELAINE: Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?

JERRY: Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.

ELAINE: Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.

(Elaine tosses her purse down and goes to the refrigerator and gets a bottled water)

GEORGE: Boy, you look really great.

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: You lie.

GEORGE: No, no you really look great.

ELAINE: Hu hu, ha ha ha.

JERRY: So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?

ELAINE: Oh, he's fine.

JERRY: Things are good?

ELAINE: Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)

JERRY: Uh oh.

ELAINE: What, Uh oh?

JERRY: Did you see that?

GEORGE: Yeah, I saw it.

(George grabs the jar of peanut butter from the kitchen counter -- he goes and sits on the couch -- he proceeds to sit quietly and eat from the jar of peanut butter.)

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: It's a tell. You gotta tell.

ELAINE: What tell? What's a tell?

JERRY: When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.

ELAINE: Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?

JERRY: Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out.  (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)

ELAINE: How high did I go?

GEORGE: You almost did the nose.

JERRY: What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)

GEORGE: What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.

JERRY: (To George) You're off bread.  (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?

(Jerry puts the lid on the peanut butter jar and put's it back in the fridge.)

ELAINE: No not quite.

JERRY: Why not?

ELAINE: Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.

GEORGE: What do you mean - "Not letting you?"

ELAINE: He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.

JERRY: Svengali.

ELAINE: What did I say?

JERRY: Svenjolly.

ELAINE: Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)

ELAINE: I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.

JERRY: Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.

(Elaine makes a face with her jaw going up and down like she is saying laa, laa, laa, laa, laa; Kramer enters)

KRAMER: You know I can't find a match anywhere.

GEORGE: You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing  somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.

ELAINE: No, it's not going to work with this guy.

GEORGE: No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.

ELAINE: I don't think so.

JERRY: Nice try.

GEORGE: Took a shot.

KRAMER: This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
 
 

[Doctor's examining room. Morty enters]

MORTY: So, when do I get to see the doctor?

NURSE: He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves)

MORTY: (checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE!  MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.

NURSE: Are you sure?

MORTY: Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?

(doctor enters)

DR. DEMBROW: Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow, I've been going over your X-rays.

MORTY: I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.

DR. DEMBROW: Well, I don't see how something like that could have happened.

MORTY: Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.

HELEN: (enters) What's going on?

MORTY: They stole my wallet.

HELEN: What?

MORTY: Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.

DR. DEMBROW: All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?

MORTY: What kind of clip joint are ya running here?

DR. DEMBROW: All right, fine. (leaves)

HELEN: The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.

MORTY: I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.

HELEN: You came all the way from Florida to see him.

MORTY: I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
 
 

[Dr. Reston's office]

ELAINE: I'm sorry but there's somebody else.

DR. RESTON: Umm hm.

ELAINE: Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.

DR. RESTON: Tell me about him.

ELAINE: Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.

DR. RESTON: Yes, well I assumed he's a guy.

ELAINE: Right...

DR. RESTON: And you've known him how long?

ELAINE: . . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.

DR. RESTON: You mean sexually?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.

(phone rings)

ELAINE: I think your um ... (points at the phone)

DR. RESTON: Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo.  Uh, no it's just east of Madison. Around 4:00 will be fine. All right Bobo ... see you then. (hangs up) . . . I'm sorry where were we?

ELAINE: Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.

DR. RESTON: Mm. Elaine ...

ELAINE: Yeah

DR. RESTON: Do you remember your dream, where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.

DR. RESTON: Elaine, I'm concerned about you.

ELAINE: Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.

DR. RESTON: Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?

ELAINE: . . . no.

DR. RESTON: And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?

ELAINE: H-his name?

DR. RESTON: Yes, his name.

ELAINE: Um, well what's the difference?

DR. RESTON: Are you afraid to tell me his name?

ELAINE: No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.

DR. RESTON: It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.

ELAINE: Uh, his name, um, I don't  - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.

DR. RESTON: Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?

ELAINE: Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.

DR. RESTON: Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.

ELAINE: What?

DR. RESTON: I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him.

ELAINE: Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.

DR. RESTON: You can do it and you will do it.

ELAINE: No, I can't.

DR. RESTON: You can and you will.

ELAINE: Okay, okay.  Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
 
 

[Restaurant]

JERRY: So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?

MORTY: I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

HELEN: Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?

MORTY: What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?

HELEN: You could've taken it with you.

MORTY: Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.

(Leo enters)

LEO: Hello...

JERRY: Hi Uncle Leo.

LEO: I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.

MORTY: What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.

LEO: You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.

MORTY: All right, Leo.

LEO: And you walked out without paying.

MORTY: How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.

LEO: Well, I hope you send him a check.

MORTY: What for?

LEO: What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.

MORTY: That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?

LEO: I said it once.

MORTY: Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.

(Leo does a little chair dance in his seat -- Mocking Morty with his hands and mouth)

HELEN: Leo, where did you get that watch?

LEO: You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?

HELEN: Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.

(Morty reaches across the table at the watch on Leo's wrist)

JERRY: Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .

HELEN: Let me see that.

(looking at watch)

JERRY: Could we continue this another time.

 

[Closing monologue]

Don't you hate "to be continued's" on TV. It's horrible when you sense the "to be continued" coming. You know, you're watching the show. You're into the story. Then there's like five minutes left and suddenly you realize, "Hey, they can't make it." Timmy's still stuck in the cave. There's no way they wrap this up in five minutes. I mean the whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I wanted a long boring story with no point to it, I have my life. A comedian can't do that, see. I can't go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig under his arm - Can you come back next week?"

(The episode opens with a series of clips from 'The Pitch', 'The Ticket' and 'TheWallet', illustrating the story so far. A rough precis would be: George turns down the offer from NBC for the show, telling Jerry he's negotiating. Susan gives George a box of Cuban cigars from her father, which hepasses to Kramer, who sets fire to his hair while lighting one. Jerry's parents come to town, so's Morty can see a back specialist - he slept on the fold-out. Kramer tells Jerry's parents that Crazy Joe Davola is after Jerry. Jerry throws away a watch his parents gave him, because it doesn't keep time. Uncle Leo fetches it out of the garbage. Jerry tells his parents his watch is at the jeweller for repair. At the doctor's, Morty reveals his hatred of velcro and his wallet disappears. Elaine returns from Europe, eager to rid herself of the 'Svenjolly' Dr Reston. George tells her to inform the doctor she's seeing someone else. Elaine opts to say she's seeing Kramer, and Dr Reston wants to meet him.)


[Opening Monologue]

JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?


[Restaurant]

(Jerry, Helen and Morty Seinfeld and uncle Leo are having dinner.)

MORTY: (to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.

JERRY: Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.

(Morty sits, brooding a little. A hostess, Naomi, passes the table. Helen watches her.)

HELEN: (indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.

JERRY: She's okay.

HELEN: Just okay?

JERRY: She's nice.

HELEN: She's better than nice.

JERRY: She's all right.

HELEN: She's beautiful.

JERRY: She's not beautiful.

HELEN: I think she's beautiful.

JERRY: So you ask her out.

HELEN: I'm not gonna ask her out.

JERRY: Why not?

HELEN: If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.

JERRY: She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

HELEN: I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.

JERRY: I think that's a little extreme.

LEO: (grudgingly) She's awright.

MORTY: (oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.


[George's Car]

GEORGE: He said what?

SUSAN: "The hell with them."

GEORGE: "The hell with them?"

SUSAN: Those were his exact words.

GEORGE: (worried) Oh boy.

SUSAN: He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"

GEORGE: (still worried) He was pretty emphatic?

SUSAN: Pounded on his desk.

GEORGE: Pounded?

SUSAN: (tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.

GEORGE: (getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.

SUSAN: You said it was insulting.

GEORGE: I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.

SUSAN: Well, there's nothing I can do.

GEORGE: Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?

SUSAN: Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.

GEORGE: Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?

SUSAN: You'll have to wait til Monday.

GEORGE: Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?

SUSAN: (laugh) I can't give you his address.

(George looks frustrated for a second, then notices Susan's purse on the dash. He grabs it, Susan grabs it and a struggle ensues.)

SUSAN: Give it back!

GEORGE: Gimme the purse!


[Kramer's Apartment]

(Elaine and Kramer sit on the couch. )

ELAINE: Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.

ELAINE: Okay.

KRAMER: Have we been intimate?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

KRAMER: Alright, how often do we do it?

ELAINE: Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?

KRAMER: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?

KRAMER: (suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)

ELAINE: Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?

KRAMER: I know what I'm gonna say.

ELAINE: No, no, but I would like to hear it.

KRAMER: No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.

(Elaine picks up the phone, while Kramer prepares himself.)

ELAINE: (dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.

KRAMER: (playing with his hair) Talk to him.

ELAINE: Hey, how's your hair?

KRAMER: Oh, well, yeah, it's good.

ELAINE: (handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.

KRAMER: (listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.

ELAINE: (mouths silently) Okay.

(Kramer holds on. He begins to sing along with the hold music.)

KRAMER: (singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...

(He waggles his eyebrows at Elaine, who gives a 'what the hell is he doing?' look.)

KRAMER: ...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...

ELAINE: (animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.

KRAMER: ...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...

(Elaine signals her approval, indicating that Kramer should keep going.)

KRAMER: ...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...

(Elaine smiles.)

KRAMER: ...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.

(Elaine looks extremely pleased, she gives Kramer okay gestures.)

ELAINE: (mouths silently) That's perfect!

KRAMER: If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.

(Elaine looks even happier. She slaps Kramer on the arm to indicate he's doing so well.)

KRAMER: Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)

(Elaine's smile begins to look a bit stiff.)

KRAMER: ...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...

(Elaine's face starts to look a bit sick.)

KRAMER: (listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...

(Kramer reaches down and picks up a writing pad, he puts it on his knee. Elaine watches, looking increasingly confused and worried.)

KRAMER: ... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.

(Kramer hangs up the phone.)

ELAINE: What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?

KRAMER: Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.

ELAINE: (horrified) Get together!!

KRAMER: He wants to talk.

ELAINE: Well, why didn't you say no!!

KRAMER: (momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.

(Elaine flops back into the couch, let down again by Kramer.)

ELAINE: (frustration) Ugh!


[Restaurant]

(Naomi, the hostess, stands by the Seinfeld's table.)

NAOMI: Did you enjoy your poisson?

HELEN: It was... different.

NAOMI: (to Jerry) And how was yours?

JERRY: Ah, very good.

NAOMI: You should try our mousse. (a little flirtatious) It'll change your life expectancy.

JERRY: No thanks, just the check.

(Naomi leaves.)

HELEN: What's the matter with you?

JERRY: What?

HELEN: Why didn't you flirt with her?

JERRY: Come on.

HELEN: She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?

JERRY: What am I gonna say?

HELEN: You just sat there.

JERRY: Well, you made me uncomfortable.

HELEN: You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?

LEO: (to Morty) Where's the bathroom?

JERRY: In the back, on your right.

(Leo gets up and leaves. The busboy brings the check to the table. As he puts it down, Morty takes hold of it. Jerry grabs it too. A tug of war develops.)

JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.

HELEN: Jerry.

JERRY: Will you let me pay just once.

MORTY: You're out of your mind.

JERRY: How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!

MORTY: Don't worry about it.

JERRY: What're you gonna do?

MORTY: What's the difference, we'll figure something out.

HELEN: (to Jerry) You're not paying.

(Jerry releases his grip, allowing a triumphant Morty to take the check.)

JERRY: Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.

(Jerry walks away. Morty reads the check, with Helen leaning to read it too.)

MORTY: How the hell am I gonna pay for this?


[Restaurant Bathroom]

(Jerry enters, to find Leo washing his hands. Leo notices Jerry in the mirror. )

LEO: They give you some portion here, huh?

JERRY: Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.

LEO: (preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.

JERRY: So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?

LEO: Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.

JERRY: Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

LEO: Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.

(Leo begins to head for the door. Jerry walks backwards, keeping pace with him.)

JERRY: Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.

LEO: (sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)

(Leo opens the door and begins to exit. Jerry grabs him by the arm.)

JERRY: (pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.


[Apartment Building Lobby]

(A uniformed doorman is on the phone to a tenant, while a nervous George stands beside him.)

DOORMAN: (into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.

GEORGE: Costanza. Costanza.

DOORMAN: (into phone) George Costanza.

GEORGE: The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.

DOORMAN: (into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday.

(A desperate George grabs the phone, and the doorman's hand, and pulls it down so's he can speak into it. )

GEORGE: (into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!

DOORMAN: Excuse me.

GEORGE: It's about the show. It... No, it was...

DOORMAN: Excuse me.

GEORGE: ...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.

(George releases his grip on the phone, and indicates the doorman should listen to it. Keeping a wary eye on George, he does.)

DOORMAN: (into phone) Very good, sir.

(A happier George slaps the doorman on the shoulder and heads toward Russell Dalrimple's apartment.)


[Restaurant]

(Morty stands, explaining his predicament to the maitre d', who speaks with an approximate French accent.)

MORTY: You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.

MAITRE D': Why don't you just let him pay, and then you can pay him back?

MORTY: No, no, he won't let me do that.

MAITRE D': Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly?

MORTY: He could wash them.

MAITRE D': Monsieur, we are running a reputable business.

MORTY: Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!

MAITRE D': Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?

MORTY: You don't understand my...

MAITRE D': Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah.


[Street Corner]

Kramer and Elaine stroll to the entrance of Dr Reston's building.

ELAINE: Now look, don't take too long.

KRAMER: (looking around) Look at this building. What is this?

ELAINE: I don't know. It's a building.

KRAMER: (indicating) The door's on a diagonal.

ELAINE: So what?

KRAMER: (looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.

ELAINE: (frustrated) Just go.

(Kramer opens the door and begins to enter. Elaine waves him goodbye, then wonders why she's doing that and gives up.)


[Russell Dalrimple's Apartment]

(Russell has opened the door to an anxious George. In the background is a set dinner table, at which sits Cynthia, Russell's beautiful date. She looks haughty and bored throughout the scene.)

GEORGE: (sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

RUSSELL: We were about to sit down to dinner.

(George motions he's sorry, but makes no effort to leave.)

RUSSELL: (indicating) This is Cynthia.

GEORGE: (entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?

RUSSELL: No.

GEORGE: Looks like veal.

RUSSELL: It's not veal.

GEORGE: Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)

RUSSELL: Who gave you my address?

GEORGE: No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.

(Russell closes the door.)

GEORGE: He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.

(Cynthia rises and slinks past George toward the living room area.)

GEORGE: Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.

RUSSELL: So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?

(Cynthia sits on the couch, and puts her wine glass on the coffee table. As George speaks, Russell crosses to the coffee table, picks up the glass and puts down a coaster, before sitting the glass on it.)

GEORGE: Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.

CYNTHIA: (bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.

GEORGE: Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...

RUSSELL: Blossom's on Monday.

GEORGE: Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)

RUSSELL: Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.

GEORGE: (worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh?  Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?

(George is opening the door.)

RUSSELL: Alright, now look. These deals are already made.

(George closes the door and turns back to Russell.)

GEORGE: Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...

(George opens the door, and is halfway through.)

RUSSELL: Mister Costanza.

(George re-enters again.)

GEORGE: Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...

(George is halfway through the door again.)

CYNTHIA: (bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?

RUSSELL: (to George) Alright. Eight thousand.

GEORGE: (pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.

(George exits and Russell closes the door firmly. As Russell returns to Cynthia, there is a tentative tap at the door. Russell opens it, to reveal George.)

GEORGE: May I just use your bathroom for a moment?


[Restaurant Bathroom]

(Leo and Jerry are mid-negotiation over the watch.)

JERRY: Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!

LEO: Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.

JERRY: Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!

LEO: (indicating) I've never seen a band like this.

JERRY: Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!

LEO: You have it on you?

JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.

(Jerry fetches out his wallet.)

JERRY: (under his breath) This is unbelievable.

(Jerry begins handing over a wad of bills to Leo. The door to the bathroom opens and Morty enters.)

MORTY: What the hell is going on here?


[Dr Reston's Office]

(On the street outside, Elaine waits, while upstairs Kramer introduces himself to Dr Reston.)

KRAMER: Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.

RESTON: (shaking hands) Thank you for coming in.

KRAMER: Thank you.

RESTON: Please, sit down.

(Dr Reston sits in one of a pair of leather armchairs which face each other, he crosses his legs.)

KRAMER: (quiet) Okay.

(Kramer sits and the leather of the chair makes a series of embarrassing rumbles and squeaks, with more of the same as he emulates Dr Reston's crossed legs sitting position.)

RESTON: Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything?

KRAMER: Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?

RESTON: I don't think we have that.

KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.

RESTON: Uh, why does that surprise you?

KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink

RESTON: This is an office.

KRAMER: That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...

RESTON: (interrupting) So tell me Mister Kramer...

KRAMER: ...Okay, yes, shoot.

RESTON: Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine.

KRAMER: Oh, alrighty uh...

(He moves in his seat, resulting in another digestive tract rumble from the leather)

KRAMER: Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.

RESTON: Is it?

KRAMER: Oh, you better believe it.


[Street Corner]

(Elaine is waiting outside for Kramer. Along the street strolls Joe Davola, singing as he goes.)

DAVOLA: (singing) '...Travelling along...'

(Elaine recognises the tune, and joins in.)

ELAINE/DAVOLA: '...singing a song, side by side...'

(Davola stops and looks at Elaine. He looks like he likes what he sees, and Elaine seems interested too. They flirt.)

ELAINE: Wow. You really have a terrible voice.

DAVOLA: Do I know you?

ELAINE: Uhh, I don't think so.

DAVOLA: 'Cos you really look familiar.

ELAINE: Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Rushmore.

DAVOLA: Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.

DAVOLA: Oh really.

ELAINE: Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.

(They laugh and smile at each other.)


[Dr. Reston's Office]

(Kramer and Dr Reston are also laughing.)

KRAMER: You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.

RESTON: I'm glad we agree.

KRAMER: (reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.

RESTON: I'd love one.

(Kramer hands over a cigar and fetches a match from his pocket.)

KRAMER: Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.

(Kramer strikes a match on the sole of his shoe.)

RESTON: If you ever feel, a need to talk to someone...

KRAMER: (lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.

RESTON: ...About anything. You have my number.

KRAMER: (lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.

(Kramer puts down the match, not noticing he's placed it on a box of tissues. He and Dr Reston puff contentedly at their cigars.)

KRAMER: Mmm, these are good, huh?

(Kramer notices he's set light to the top tissue in the box.)

KRAMER: (quiet) Oh.

(Kramer pulls the smouldering tissue from the box. He shakes it to put out the fire, but a piece falls to the floor. As he reaches for it, he keeps the rest of the tissue in his hand, where it burns his fingers. He jumps, almost dropping his cigar, and sucks at his burned digits.)


[Street Corner]

(Elaine is using Davola's back as a rest as she jots her number on a piece of paper.)

ELAINE: I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?

DAVOLA: No, I don't think so.

(Elaine hands the piece of paper and the pen back to Davola as they laugh at the ludicrous possibility that he might be a nut.)


[Restaurant]

(Naomi is handing her card to Jerry.)

JERRY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.

NAOMI: (joking) Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here.

JERRY: Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.

NAOMI: (playing it straight) Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on uncle Leo.

JERRY: Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?

NAOMI: Why?

JERRY: They eat fish.

(Naomi starts to laugh at his joke. It is, of course, the laugh later described as 'Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer'. It's loud and persistent. Jerry leaves, but then leans back around the corner with a look of disbelief on his face.)


[Lobby In Dr. Reston's Office]

(A cheerful Joe Davola waits for the elevator to arrive, whistling 'Side By Side'. The elevator arrives with a ding of the bell. The door opens and Kramer steps out, shielded from Davola by other passengers. Kramer walks away, relighting his cigar, as Davola enters the elevator, still whistling happily.)


[Street Corner]

(Elaine sits on the steps outside the building. The door opens and one of the other elevator passengers exits, he releases the door, which swings shut, almost striking Kramer. Kramer walks toward Elaine.)

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: What happened? What took you so long?

KRAMER: Hey, he's a terrific guy.

ELAINE: Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?

KRAMER: Well, we talked about a lot of things.

(The camera pans up, toward the lighted window of Dr Reston's office.)

ELAINE (O.C.): You talked about a lot of things? Well...

KRAMER (O.C.): Yeah.

ELAINE (O.C.): Did you talk about us?

(Elaine and Kramer's voices fade out, and the voices inside the window fade up.)

DAVOLA (O.C.): I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her
name's Elaine. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

RESTON (O.C.): Did you say Elaine?


[Middle Monologue]

JERRY: How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"


[Jerry's Apartment]

(Jerry brings his parents' cases from the bedroom. Helen is finishing packing.)

MORTY: You shoulda told me it didn't work.

JERRY: I know, I know.

HELEN: You didn't have to throw it out.

JERRY: I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.

(The buzzer sounds.)

HELEN: Oh, that must be Leo.

JERRY: I woulda taken you to the airport.

HELEN: He has nothing to do.

JERRY: Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?

GEORGE (O.S.): It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. (to parents) It's George.

MORTY: Oh, it's George.

HELEN: What ever happened with NBC and the deal?

JERRY: Ah, George turned it down.

HELEN: He turned it down?

JERRY: Yeah.

HELEN: Why did he do that?

JERRY: Because of Ted Danson.

HELEN: What does Ted Danson have to do with it?

MORTY: Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

JERRY: (fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.

(George enters.)

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Hey.

MORTY: Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?

GEORGE: Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?

(He approaches Helen for a greeting.)

HELEN: What's the matter with you?

GEORGE: What'd I do?

JERRY: What about NBC? Did you hear anything?

GEORGE: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

(Jerry looks expectantly, but George makes him wait.)

GEORGE: We got a deal.

(There is an outpouring of jubilation and congratulations aimed at George.)

MORTY/HELEN/JERRY: (simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!

JERRY: Heyy! Terrific.

MORTY: You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)

GEORGE: Uh, please, Morty.

MORTY: No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)

GEORGE: I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...

JERRY: Aww...

GEORGE: ...Who's not doing this for the money.

JERRY: ...C'mon.

GEORGE: You have no idea how refreshing that is.

JERRY: So what'd we get?

GEORGE: (big smile) Eight thousand dollars.

JERRY: Beautiful!

GEORGE: (quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.

HELEN: Four thousand apiece?

JERRY: Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
for... less money.

GEORGE: I was wrong, you were right.

JERRY: You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.

GEORGE: You're smart, I'm dumb.

JERRY: You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.

(The buzzer sounds.)

HELEN: That's gotta be Leo.

JERRY: (to intercom) Yeah?

LEO (O.C.): Leo.

JERRY: Alright, we're coming down.

MORTY: Alright, let's get going.

JERRY: Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.

(Jerry fetches a small package from the kitchen drawer and offers it to Morty.)

JERRY: A present.

MORTY: A present?

(Morty opens it.)

MORTY: Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.

JERRY: C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.

HELEN: I hope you didn't spend too much on that.

MORTY: I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.

HELEN: He's something, you son, isn't he?

JERRY: Ah hah, alright, let's go.

(Everyone begins to head for the door.)

MORTY: You're a terrific kid.

(Jerry picks up a case.)

JERRY: Okay.

GEORGE: Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

(George picks up the other case, as Morty and Helen exit.)

HELEN: How could anybody not like you?

GEORGE: (to Jerry) You're very special.

JERRY: (pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.


[Street]

(Uncle Leo has the trunk of his car open and looks impatient.)

LEO: Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.

MORTY: Alright, Leo.

JERRY: Hey, uncle Leo.

LEO: Hi, hi...

JERRY: How you doing?

(There are murmurs of greetings.)

JERRY: This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.

LEO: Yeah, I hate to give it up.

JERRY: Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?

MORTY: Jerry!

JERRY: Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.

HELEN: (hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.

GEORGE: Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.

MORTY: Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.

GEORGE: (shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.

JERRY: Take care now. So long.

(Jerry and George walk away to cross the street back to the apartment. They speak quietly, so's Helen and Morty don't overhear.)

GEORGE: Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.

JERRY: Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.

GEORGE: You're kidding.

JERRY: He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.

GEORGE: Man, would I like to see the look on his face.

(Jerry gives a final wave to his parents. They wave back.)

MORTY: You believe this?

HELEN: What?

MORTY: (indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.

HELEN: You're kidding.

MORTY: Who needs this?

(He tosses the wallet into the trash bin.)

MORTY: Leo, let's go.

(Morty and Helen climb into Leo's car. Leo closes the trunk and walks toward the driver's door. He stops, as something catches his eye. Leo picks the wallet out of the trash, looks around to see if anyone's watching, and tucks it into his pocket as he goes to get in the car.)


[Closing Monologue]

JERRY: ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."

Comedy club - Jerry on stage with the opening monologue

JERRY: Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?  You wanted the machine.  You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."

So here what we have is two people who hate each other, don't really ever want to talk, but the phone machine is like this relationship respirator keeping these marginal brain dead relationships alive.  And we all do it -- Why? So that when we come home, you can see that little flashing red light.  You go "all right, messages."  You see, people need that.  It's very important for human beings to feel they are popular and well liked amongst a large group of people that we don't care for.
 

Stock shot of Hunan Chinese restaurant at night

(Jerry and Naomi enter Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: Well this is it.

NAOMI: Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.

JERRY: Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.

NAOMI: Yeah, me too.

JERRY: No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.

NAOMI: (laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?

JERRY: No, I mean, I don't think so.

NAOMI: I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.

JERRY: No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.

NAOMI: Ahahahahahahahahaha.

JERRY: That's not funny Naomi.

NAOMI: Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry)

JERRY: I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.

(Jerry goes over to the answering machine and plays the message, then walks back over to the kitchen to get a drink from his bottled water.  Naomi sits on the couch looking through the TV Guide, also listening to George's message)

GEORGE: (on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.

(Naomi smiles. Jerry takes a sip of water)

GEORGE: (con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?

(Naomi stops reading, looks up, pondering what George just said.  Jerry puts down his water and sprints over to the machine)

GEORGE: (con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...

(Jerry trying to stop the tape -- he rips the answering machine out of the wall plug)

JERRY: This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)

NAOMI: You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?

JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.

 

[in Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?

GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?

JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!

GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.

JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.

GEORGE: What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.

JERRY: Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.

GEORGE: Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.

JERRY: Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.

GEORGE: Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.

JERRY: Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?

(Kramer enters smoking a cigar)

KRAMER: Hmm.

JERRY: Ah, Kramer.

KRAMER: Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
What do ya be?

JERRY: Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.

KRAMER: So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?

JERRY and GEORGE: uh uh, we're uh ..

KRAMER: Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.

JERRY: Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

KRAMER: Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.

JERRY: and GEORGE: Ye, hu, um Ye,

KRAMER: Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.  Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)

GEORGE: Gee, that's-that's too bad.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad.

KRAMER: Why? What wa?

GEORGE: Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend.  Susan's father has a cabin up there.  But, eh, all right, well.

KRAMER: Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?

JERRY and GEORGE: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

GEORGE: No, no that's ah, that's pie country.

JERRY: Yeah

GEORGE: Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

JERRY: They sell them by the side of the road.  Blueberry, Blackberry ....

GEORGE: Blackberry, Boysenberry ...

JERRY: Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...

GEORGE: Huckleberry, Raspberry...

JERRY: Raspberry, Strawberry ...

GEORGE: Strawberry, Cranberry ...

JERRY: Peach.
 
 
 

(MONKS)

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.

ELAINE: What's that?

JERRY: Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.

ELAINE: "I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?

JERRY: Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?

ELAINE: Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!

JERRY: Well, um same bed ...

ELAINE: uh huh (very quietly)

JERRY: .. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.

ELAINE: What about me?

JERRY: Well you'd be naked of course.

ELAINE: Uh, that's, ...

MEL: Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld?

JERRY: Yeah.

MEL: My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger.

JERRY: Hi.

MEL: I drive that truck out there.

JERRY: Oh, the Yoo Hoo?

MEL: Yeah.

JERRY: I love Yoo Hoo.

MEL: Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble.

JERRY: A bubble?

ELAINE: A bubble?

MEL: Yes, a bubble!

MEL: Do you mind? May I?

ELAINE: Oh, sure.

(Mel sits down with them)

MEL: Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy.

(breaks up in tears)

MEL: (in tears) Excuse me, I ah ...

ELAINE: Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)

(MEL AND ELAINE WIPE TEARS FROM THEIR EYES, JERRY WIPES CRUMBS FROM HIS MOUTH and picks his teeth at the corner of his mouth)

MEL: Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV.

JERRY: You get in the bubble with him?

MEL: No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic.

JERRY: Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.

MEL: No, it's clear.

JERRY: Ah ha.

ELAINE: Who has the remote?  (wipes a tear from her eye)

MEL: He does.

ELAINE: The remote goes through the bubble?

MEL: Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote.

JERRY: So you have no control over the remote?

MEL: No, it's frustrating.

JERRY: Mmm

ELAINE: Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)

MEL: So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin.

JERRY: Awe... That's nice!

MEL: Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit and, just say hello.

JERRY: Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...

ELAINE: Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.

JERRY: Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?

MEL: No, up state.

JERRY: Up state! Hummm.
 
 

(Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: He's a bubble boy.

GEORGE: A bubble boy?

JERRY: Yes. A bubble boy.

SUSAN: What's a bubble boy?

JERRY: He lives in a bubble.

GEORGE: Boy!

SUSAN: Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?

JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.

SUSAN: Oh.

GEORGE: What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?

JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.  It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.

SUSAN: Well, where does he live?

JERRY: I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'

SUSAN: Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.

GEORGE: Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.

JERRY: You think we can do it?

SUSAN: Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.

JERRY: Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.

GEORGE: (laughs) hu hu.

SUSAN: I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.

JERRY: Ohh.

GEORGE: All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.

JERRY: OK.

(Kramer enters with golf bag, clubs and outfit, smoking a cigar)

KRAMER: Well,

GEORGE: and JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice.

(Susan recoils at his presence)

KRAMER: Well, I'm off to the links.

GEORGE: and JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.

GEORGE: (clears his throat)

SUSAN: The what?

GEORGE: Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.

SUSAN: Did you ...  (George grabs her hand)

GEORGE: No, no, no we'll talk about it later.

SUSAN: Is that one of the cigars my father gave you?  (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
 
 

(2 cars on the road George leading, Jerry following --)

(IN Jerry's car on highway)

ELAINE: Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?

JERRY: Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?

ELAINE: Oh, that's nice!

JERRY: What's he doing? What is his hurry?

(George's car pulls away at a high rate of speed)

ELAINE: Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.

JERRY: I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
I-I never heard the end of it

ELAINE: Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)

JERRY: Look at him.

ELAINE: Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)

(In George's car)

GEORGE: Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?

SUSAN: Why?

GEORGE:  Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh.  Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.

(Jerry's car)

JERRY: What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?

ELAINE: Isn't that blue car him?

JERRY: No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?

ELAINE: It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.

JERRY: I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.

ELAINE: Wa',you don't have the directions?

JERRY: No, I was following him.

ELAINE: How could you not take the directions?

JERRY: Because, HE'S my directions.

(from George's car)

SUSAN: I didn't see them George.

(Jerry ranting in his car)

JERRY: We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -

ELAINE: Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.

JERRY: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.

ELAINE: Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.

(from George's car)

SUSAN: We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!

GEORGE: Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?

SUSAN: Well now what are you gonna do?

GEORGE: It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.

SUSAN: Does he have the address?
 
 

(Jerry's apartment - Kramer enters - singing something undeterminable, he picks up a piece of paper from the counter)

JERRY: (answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.

NAOMI: (on phone speaker) Hi, Jerry it's Naomi.  Ah, listen, if its not too late I, changed my mind, I'd like to go to the cabin.

KRAMER: Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
 
 

(Kramer's car)

KRAMER: So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?

NAOMI: No.

KRAMER: These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.

NAOMI: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha haaaa

(Kramer points at her and laughs)
 
 

(The Sangers' house, on the front porch)

GEORGE: I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.

(Susan smooches him - playfully biting George's right ear lobe)

GEORGE: Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again)  Would you quit it please.  Someone is going to see us here.

SUSAN: So what? You are SUCH a prude.

GEORGE: Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)

SUSAN: Okay, Come on lets go in.

GEORGE: What?

SUSAN: Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.

GEORGE: I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.

SUSAN: What's the matter?

GEORGE: I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.

SUSAN: Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.

GEORGE: Susan, wait please... (grabs her)  Please ...

SUSAN: Come on George. George stop. George.

GEORGE: Susan, Susan would you wai,....
 
 

(Highway diner)

JERRY: (ranting)  I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.

ELAINE: Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?

JERRY: Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy?  I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?

(Elaine stares at him and blows a bubble with bubble gum.  The waitress comes up to the counter.)

JERRY: I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.

WAITRESS: How ?bout you?

ELAINE: Um, I'll just have a glass of water.

(the waitress turns and walks away)

JERRY: (whispers) You can't just have water.

ELAINE: Why not? That's all I want.

JERRY: Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.

(the waitress comes back and pulls out a cup and saucer)

WAITRESS: Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV?

JERRY: Oh, no.

ELAINE: YES! yes. You saw him on TV.

WAITRESS: What's your name?

ELAINE: Jerry Seinfeld.

JERRY: Elaaaiinne...

WAITRESS: Garry Seinfield! I saw you on the Tonight Show.

ELAINE: Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?

WAITRESS: Oh, ha ha

JERRY: Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.

ELAINE: He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.

JERRY: I'm not lying.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)

JERRY: She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
 
 
 

(Sanger's house)

MRS. SANGER: See it's not really a bubble. A lot of people think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic divider.

GEORGE: Huh (quietly)

GEORGE: and SUSAN: (nod)

(long pause)

GEORGE: Can you uh, go in the bubble?

MRS. SANGER: Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs.

MEL: The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production.

GEORGE: So then he makes his own bed?

MRS. SANGER: Well, that's one of the things we fight about.

(George points at her, understanding what she is saying)

MEL: Would you like to meet him?

GEORGE: Uh, well, you know,...

MRS. SANGER: Oh, he loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him.

DONALD: HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER, I'M GONNA SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE.

MRS. SANGER: (embarrassed) Ha...ha ha ha ha, ha.
 
 

(Highway Diner)

ELAINE: (laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.

JERRY: Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.

ELAINE: Where's my water?

JERRY: Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.

WAITRESS: Thanks.

ELAINE: Waddya' write?

WAITRESS: "Nothing's finer than being in your diner."

ELAINE: Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?

JERRY: No good?

ELAINE: THIS is what you came up with?

JERRY: Well.

ELAINE: That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.

WAITRESS: Why

JERRY: I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.

WAITRESS: It's good. I like it.

JERRY: No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.

WAITRESS: Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.

JERRY: No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.

WAITRESS: RIGHT! (leaves)
 
 
 

(Donald's room)

MRS. SANGER: This is Donald.

GEORGE: Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.

SUSAN: Hello.

DONALD: WHO ARE YOU? Where's Seinfeld?

MRS. SANGER: He's on his way. These are his friends.

DONALD: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? NEVER SEEN A KID IN A BUBBLE BEFORE?

GEORGE: Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know.  I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.

DONALD: WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

SUSAN: I-I-I have no story.

GEORGE: She works for NBC.

DONALD: HOW 'BOUT TAKING YOUR TOP OFF?

MRS. SANGER: Donald, behave yourself.

DONALD: COME ON.

MRS. SANGER: I know. I know. Why don't you play a game of Trivial Pursuit?

GEORGE: Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...

DONALD: Ooo. WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID?

GEORGE: A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...

DONALD: WELL I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
 
 

(Highway Diner)

JERRY: Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.

WAITRESS: You are really startin' to get under my skin.

JERRY: I want that picture.

WAITRESS: Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.

(Elaine digging into the roast chicken)

JERRY: I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.

WAITRESS: Well, you ain't getting' it back.

JERRY: Well, maybe I'll just take it back.

(The waitress hits the picture on the wall with her open hand flush against it)

ELAINE: This chicken is really good.
 
 

(Bubble Boy's room - George pulls a Trivial Pursuit card -- The Bubble Boy's right arm ala space suit type arm and a glove at the end to protect him)

DONALD: OK, HISTORY ... THIS IS FOR THE GAME. ... HOW YA DOIN' OVER THERE? ... NOT TOO GOOD!

GEORGE: All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?

DONALD: THAT'S A JOKE. THE MOORS.

GEORGE: Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.

DONALD: MOOPS? LET ME SEE THAT. THAT'S NOT MOOPS YOU JERK, IT'S MOORS. IT'S A MISPRINT.

GEORGE: I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.

DONALD: IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S MOORS. THERE'S NO, MOOPS.

GEORGE: It's MOOPS.

DONALD: MOORS.

GEORGE: MOOPS,

DONALD: MOORS!
 
 

(The cabin)

KRAMER: Hey!  Anybody home?  Oh boy.

NAOMI: What should we do?

KRAMER: Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies.

(Kramer opens a window by the front door of the cabin)

KRAMER: Okay.

( Kramer falls in through the open window knocking over a bunch of stuff)
 
 

(Donald's room)

GEORGE: Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)

DONALD: THERE'S NO MOOPS. YOU IDIOT.

SUSAN: Stop it. Let go of him!

Mrs. SANGER: Donald, stop it! Now, let go of him Donald. Donald!

DONALD: I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.

GEORGE: You're choking me.

Mrs. SANGER: Donald, ... Donald...

DONALD: MOORS. SAY MOORS!

GEORGE: MOOPS, MOOPS

Mrs. SANGER: Donald, No. ... Donald, stop it ..

(Susan bursts the bubble)

(hissing sound and Donald's hands leave George's throat)
 
 

(Highway Diner)

(Waitress is strangling Jerry, the cook is grabbing Jerry, Elaine is grabbing the cook)

JERRY: What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!

WAITRESS: Are you going to pay for that?

JERRY: No, I want the picture back.

(angry guy enters)

MAN #1: Something's happened to the Bubble Boy. They're rushing him to the hospital.

WAITRESS: What? (releases Jerry)

JERRY: The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?

MAN #1: That's his house right down the road.

MAN #2: He got in a fight with some guy.

Guy1: What kind of person would hurt the Bubble Boy?

MAN #2: Some little bald guy from the city.

MAN #1: Come on -- Vern, Page, Preston, don't you think we ought to do somethin'?

(Elaine and Jerry make their escape)
 
 

(The cabin)

KRAMER: Naomi, come on let's get goin'.

(Kramer is smoking a Cuban cigar and testing a fishing rod and reel)

NAOMI: But that lake must be freezing.

(Kramer sets his burning cigar on the mantle above the fireplace)

KRAMER: Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.

(Kramer casts the fishing pole away and pulls it back in -- it hits him in the face, startling himself.  Naomi enters in a blue robe with a couple of towels -- she tosses one to Kramer, which he does not catch.)

NAOMI: Ready to go swimming?

KRAMER: Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside)  GOTCHA.

NAOMI: AHAaaaaaha

KRAMER: HeYAWaaa
 
(Kramer pulls the door behind them as they run out -- Camera shot of the lit cigar -- it falls from the mantle onto a pile of newspapers -- either from the vibration of the door being closed or the vacuum of air being created that causes the cigar to fall -- either way, the cigar was placed on the mantle in a precarious position.)
 
 

(The Sanger house)

(George stands in the open front door.  The emergency lights can be seen flashing in the reflection of the window -- he motions with both hands to Susan lets go? She comes out the door and he puts his hand to her back as a slight gesture as the walk down the few steps)

GEORGE: JERRY! What happened to you?

JERRY: What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.

GEORGE: Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.

(Mel Sanger and his wife exit the house and head off camera towards the emergency vehicles.)

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Yeah, Susan tell him.

SUSAN: It's a long story.

GEORGE: Yeah.

(Two emergency med. techs. pulling a stretcher on wheels out the door with Donald the Bubble Boy? on it. They stop so he can talk to the group.)

DONALD: HEY SEINFELD!

JERRY: Hey, Happy Birthday.

ELAINE: Hi.

DONALD: THANKS FOR SHOWING UP. YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND HERE TRIED TO KILL ME.

GEORGE: Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?

DONALD: MOORS

GEORGE: MOOPS

DONALD: MOORS

GEORGE: MOOPS

DONALD: MOORS

GEORGE: MOOPS

(The towns people arrive - about 10 of them)

MAN #1: There's the guy who tried to kill the Bubble Boy. Get him!

GEORGE: Go, go, get out, ...

(Our heroes scrambling -- they run for it)
 
 

(Night shot of a fire truck racing down the road, passing cars, sirens blasting, lights flashing)

(Jerry's car -- Jerry's and Elaine)

JERRY: Fire engines?

(Jerry looks as the fire truck passes his car)

(George's car -- Susan looks tired as her head is on the head rest -- she rolls her head to the side to glance at the fire truck cruising by)

GEORGE: What? Must be a big one.
 
 

(Night shot -- In the woods, a smoky haze, backlit with streams of blue light and smoke through the trees)

ELAINE: Do you smell something?

JERRY: Yeah,

SUSAN: Smoke.

GEORGE: Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke.

ELAINE: Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)

(They emerge from the woods -- Susan first carrying a flashlight and a red bag, George with a bag of groceries, Elaine and Jerry follow  -- they stand looking at the burning cabin)

(Night shot of the cabin burning)

JERRY: Holy cow! look at that!

SUSAN: IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!

ELAINE: The CABIN is on fire!

GEORGE: (Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.

ELAINE: How could this have happened?

(Kramer and Naomi arrive wearing their robes, with the towels over their shoulders)

KRAMER: (singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...

NAOMI: Oh, my god, the cabin?

JERRY: What are you two doin' here?

NAOMI: Look at that.

(Night shot of the cabin burning)

JERRY: You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)

KRAMER: My Cubans!  (runs off to the burning cabin)
 
 

[Jerry on stage - Closing monologue]

Something very scary and exciting about fire, ah people always run to see a fire. They're very proud, if they have a fireplace.  And I think that's what smoking is really all about.  That's the power of smoke it's just this thing (pretends to be smoking) -- ?I got fire right here in my hand. Smoke and fire is literally, coming right out of my mouth.?

And it's very intimidating to the non-smoker, ?cause it's like talking to someone that's going my head could open up, lava could explode out, pour right down my face, doesn't bother me a bit.

And then a cigar is even worse -- I mean a cigar, is like -- you think this end is bad, look at this wet, disgusting, chewed up nub huh -- How scary is that??

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and George enter with some plastic bags)

JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?

GEORGE: No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.

JERRY: "We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?

GEORGE: Susan wants me to be there.

JERRY: You're meetin' the father for the first time?

GEORGE: (Reluctantly) Yeah.

JERRY: (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.

GEORGE: I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!

JERRY: (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..

GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.

JERRY: No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..

GEORGE: (Getting frustrated) I know.

JERRY: (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..

GEORGE: Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.

JERRY: (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.

GEORGE: (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..

JERRY: (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.

GEORGE: We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.

JERRY: (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.

GEORGE: (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?

JERRY: What, you got a problem with the pen now?

GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.

JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.

GEORGE: (Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?

JERRY: (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.

GEORGE: (Offering) Drink?

JERRY: No, no thank you.

GEORGE: (Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Act I, Scene A..

(A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes)

GEORGE: Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?

JERRY: (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?

(Scene cuts to Elaine's office. She's waving a pencil around in her free hand)

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?

(Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)

GEORGE: Alright, here we go. You got it?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.

GEORGE: (Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?

(A long pause, then the scene jumps back to Elaine and Sandra)

ELAINE: Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?

SANDRA: Why? Did Jerry say something?

ELAINE: No, no.

SANDRA: He must have said something.

ELAINE: Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

SANDRA: (Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)

ELAINE: (Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!

(Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George are sleeping. Kramer slams his apartment door shut, waking both of them up)

GEORGE: Alright, let's go.

JERRY: Here we go.

(Both get situated to write as Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..

JERRY: Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?

KRAMER: (Complaining) No more golf.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: (Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?

GEORGE: What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!

KRAMER: Why? What's one thing got to do with another?

GEORGE: Kramer, please.

KRAMER: Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!

GEORGE: Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.

KRAMER: (Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)

GEORGE: (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.

JERRY: What?!

GEORGE: Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.

JERRY: (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?

GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: The Ross' house]

(Susan, her parents, and George are all dining)

MRS. ROSS: (To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?

MR. ROSS: (Gruff) A slight resemblance.

(George laughs slightly)

MRS. ROSS: (To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

GEORGE: Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..

(Seeing the Ross' expression, he trails off)

MR. ROSS: How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?

GEORGE: Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

MR. ROSS: You know those cigars are made special for Castro?

GEORGE: (Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)

MR. ROSS: What?

SUSAN: (Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.

MR. ROSS: I didn't care much for his jokes.

SUSAN: (To George) Daddy never laughs.

GEORGE: Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?

MR. ROSS: You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.

MRS. ROSS: You and your cigars..

MR. ROSS: (Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.

SUSAN: Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..

MR. ROSS: Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?

GEORGE: (Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and Elaine are talking. Jerry's using a harsh tone)

JERRY: Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!

ELAINE: (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?

JERRY: (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?

ELAINE: (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.

JERRY: (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: The Ross' house]

(Same diner party is going on. News of the cabin has yet to be discussed)

GEORGE: The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?

SUSAN: Uhh.. about the cabin..

MR. ROSS: (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.

GEORGE: (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.

MR. ROSS: What?

GEORGE: S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..

MR. ROSS: When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)

MRS. ROSS: (Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.

SUSAN: Daddy..

MR. ROSS: Yes?

SUSAN: Daddy, about the cabin..

MRS. ROSS: (Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)

MR. ROSS: (To Susan) What about it?

SUSAN: Well, the thing is..

MR. ROSS: What? What is it?

SUSAN: Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?

GEORGE: (Extremely blunt) Burned.

MR. ROSS: Burned?

SUSAN: There was a fire, and it uh..

GEORGE: Burned.

MR. ROSS: (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?

GEORGE: (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..

MRS. ROSS: (Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)

MR. ROSS: Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?

SUSAN: (Solemn) No. Nothing.

MRS. ROSS: (Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.

(Mr. Ross, devastated, slowly gets up and starts walking toward the room's exit as everyone continues to talk)

GEORGE: Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Sandra runs out of Jerry's room, hastily putting on her jacket. Jerry follow, buttoning his shirt)

SANDRA: (Offended) I can't believe you said that!

JERRY: What?!

SANDRA: (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!

JERRY: What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!

SANDRA: That was a weird thing to say.

JERRY: Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

SANDRA: Ohh, I think you're really sick.

JERRY: (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.

SANDRA: I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)

JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.

SANDRA: (Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)

JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.

SANDRA: (Opens the door) That's ok.

JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.

SANDRA: Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)

JERRY: (Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: The Coffee shop]

(Jerry's telling George about last night)

JERRY: So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.

GEORGE: Wo-hoah! What did you do?

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"

GEORGE: Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?

JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..

GEORGE: Alright, so, go ahead.

JERRY: So we go back to my apartment..

GEORGE: (Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!

JERRY: So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.

GEORGE: (Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?

JERRY: (Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..

GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?

JERRY: Typical things.

GEORGE: (Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.

JERRY: She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)

GEORGE: (Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.

JERRY: ..And then she starts talking about her panties.

GEORGE: (Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!

JERRY: So I said something.

GEORGE: Ok, what did you say?

JERRY: (Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.

GEORGE: Of course.

JERRY: Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"

GEORGE: (Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?

JERRY: (Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.

GEORGE: Well, how did she react?

JERRY: She flipped out! Just left.

GEORGE: Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.

GEORGE; Well, what if this girl says something?

JERRY: She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.

JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.

GEORGE: Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.

JERRY: (Getting up) Alright, big work day.

GEORGE: That's right.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and George, with their writing materials, go to sit down in the living room while giving each other pep talks)

GEORGE: Okay.

JERRY: Let's go.

GEORGE: Here we are.

JERRY: Right now.

GEORGE: Let's do it.

JERRY: You and me.

GEORGE: Okay.

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: What'dya got?

JERRY: (Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Oh, hey.

(Both George and Jerry get up, giving Kramer an excited greeting - talking fast, together) Oh, you guys are working? I'll come back. (Turns to leave. Jerry and George strongly protest with a series of "No, no, no!"'s) No, you guys should get back to work. (More protests)

GEORGE: Don't be silly.

JERRY: Come in, we're taking a break.

KRAMER: (Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?

JERRY: Yeah!

KRAMER: Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?

GEORGE: (Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.

KRAMER: (Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building]

(Kramer walks up to a secretary)

KRAMER: Buenos dias.

SECRETARY: Buenos dias.

KRAMER: Uh, habla ingles?

SECRETARY: Si.

KRAMER: Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.

SECRETARY: What is this about?

KRAMER: Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.

SECRETARY: Are you an American?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah.

SECRETARY: I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone)

KRAMER: Okay.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry, curled up on his living room chair, and George, laid out on the sofa, are asleep. Jerry's buzzer goes off, waking them up. George rolls off the couch and falls to the floor)

JERRY: (Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

JERRY: C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)

GEORGE: (Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..

JERRY: (Agreeing) Yeah, we should.

GEORGE: Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?

JERRY: Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?

GEORGE: No, no, no, no.

JERRY: Oh.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.

JERRY: Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.

ELAINE: Why? What happened? Did you talk?

JERRY: Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Really? You really think I should fire her?

JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.

(George, sitting out the couch, dozes off to sleep)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building]

(A group of men in suits walk out into the lobby to deal with Kramer)

MAN: (To secretary) Expira te afuera.

KRAMER: (Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.

MAN: What is your name, Senor?

KRAMER: Uh, Kramer.

MAN: So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?

KRAMER: (Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.

MAN: (Confused) Cigars?

KRAMER: (Definite) Cigars.

MAN: What about cigars?

KRAMER: Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..

MAN: Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..

KRAMER: (Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?

MAN: (Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.

KRAMER: Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?

(The man is staring at Kramer's clothes, mesmerized. He reaches out to touch Kramer's legendary jacket)

MAN: I like that jacket..

(Scene ends)


[Setting: The Ross' apartment]

(There's a knock at the door. Susan answers it - it's Jerry and George)

SUSAN: Hi!

GEORGE: Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)

SUSAN: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi.

SUSAN: I thought you two guys were working today.

JERRY: Ah, just - takin' a little break.

GEORGE: (Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)

SUSAN: Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.

GEORGE: Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?

RICKY: (Blunt) I don't have one.

GEORGE: Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)

SUSAN: (Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.

SARA: (Staring at George) He doesn't look like me.

MRS. ROSS: Sara, what do you have on your wheels?

SARA: Nothing, they're clean.

MRS. ROSS: Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

RICKY: (Annoyed) Yes.

MRS. ROSS: (Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.

(Doorbell rings)

SUSAN: Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.

RAYMOND: Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.

SUSAN: (Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.

GEORGE: Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)

SUSAN: From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.

JERRY AND GEORGE: Oh, wow.

SUSAN: (Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)

(A long pause)

GEORGE: Well, we.. we, we, ah..

JERRY: (Looking at his watch ) Yeah..

GEORGE: We really should be, uh, heading out..

JERRY: Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.

GEORGE: You know, the time..

(Susan's father is now standing in the hallway)

MR. ROSS: The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?!

MRS. ROSS: (Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!

SARA: (Yelling out) I knew it!

MRS. ROSS: I want to know who John is!

RICKEY: John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!

MR. ROSS: (Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go)

GEORGE: Well, we really should be-

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.

JERRY: Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.

GEORGE: yeah, time is what he's indicating there..

JERRY: (Waving good bye) We'll see ya.

GEORGE: Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.

(Jerry grabs George, leaving)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and George, once again, are sitting down in the living room, attempting to write)

GEORGE: Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Alright, let's go.

GEORGE: Come on now.

JERRY: Right now.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: You and me.

GEORGE: You got it.

JERRY: No foolin'

GEORGE: Ok, so, what'dya got?

JERRY: (Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".

GEORGE: Alright, so, we need something..

JERRY: Yeah.. how about this: I say "How's it goin'?"

GEORGE: "How's it going?" - beautiful.

(They both start to write it down as a pounding on the door sounds) Oh, come on, we were just on a roll now..

JERRY: (Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?

GEORGE: (Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"

JERRY: Did you write it down?

GEORGE: I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"

JERRY: Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)

ELAINE: Real good!

JERRY: What?!

ELAINE: Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!

JERRY: What?! How?

ELAINE: I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!

JERRY: What calls?!

ELAINE: Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!

JERRY: Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?

ELAINE: (Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?

JERRY: So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?

ELAINE: Yeah!

JERRY: (Smiling to himself) Beautiful.

ELAINE: Why is that beautiful?

JERRY: Oh, no, not beautiful.

ELAINE: It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!

JERRY: Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.

ELAINE: No, no.

JERRY: (Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-

ELAINE: (Giving up too easy) Okay.

JERRY: (Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?

(Elaine opens the door to find Kramer and the 3 Cubans dressed up in golf wear, smoking cigars)

KRAMER: Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.

JERRY: Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.

KRAMER: Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.

JERRY: Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..

KRAMER: (Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!

(They exit)

ELAINE: (Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?

GEORGE: Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.

ELAINE: (To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.

ELAINE: (Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.

JERRY: (Moving back into the living room) Okay.

ELAINE: (In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)

The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over and she marries the next guy. That?s why the wedding vow isn't 'do you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.


[INSIDE JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: (answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA: Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.



[JERRY'S APARTMENT.]

(Kramer and Jerry enter)

KRAMER: So, what do you think?

JERRY: About what?

KRAMER: About the opera.

JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna go.

KRAMER: You gotta go.

JERRY: I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!

KRAMER: Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.

JERRY: All right, all right.

KRAMER: That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language

JERRY: So why don't they talk like that now?

KRAMER: Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.

(BUZZER)

KRAMER: Better get that

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: (intercom) it?s me!

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: So, huh?

JERRY: I don't know

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.

JERRY: Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.

KRAMER: Oh, well I have many associates.

JERRY: I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.

KRAMER: All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.

JERRY: No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?

KRAMER: You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!

JERRY: Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.

(ELAINE ENTERS)

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hi!

KRAMER: Hey! Hi Elaine!

ELAINE: You got the tickets right?

KRAMER: Well no, I don't have them on me.

ELAINE: What? That?s why I came all the way over here.

KRAMER: My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.

ELAINE: Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?

KRAMER: Oh yeah!

JERRY: So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.

ELAINE: Its killing you isn?t it?

JERRY: Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera

ELAINE: Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.


[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(Opera music playing (Paliachi?) Divola is crying while lifting weights. Photos of Elaine are scattered on the floor.)


[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.

ELAINE: I've got to go

JERRY: Where are you going, what?s the rush?

ELAINE: I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'

JERRY: Oh, good, men love that!

(Kramer is reading Jerry's mail under the lamp.)

JERRY: Hey!

KRAMER: You've got a message buddy.

JERRY: Ooo, could be from that blonde

KRAMER: Oo yiggity diggigg

JOE DIVOLA: (answering machine message)'Jerry, Joe Divola. I have a hair on my tongue'


[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(Divola has his hand over a candle and is laughing)


[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: (shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....

KRAMER: Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,

JERRY: What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?

KRAMER: OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!

JERRY: I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.

KRAMER: The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!

JERRY: What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!

KRAMER: Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.

JERRY: I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.

KRAMER: Call him and tell him

JERRY: That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?

KRAMER: Right.... Don't mention my name

JERRY: Oh, I got the machine.

KRAMER: What?s his message like?

JERRY: Nice!

KRAMER: Eh!

JERRY: (into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,

KRAMER: Big! Big!

JERRY: and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.


[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(The door is open. Elaine knocks and then enters)

ELAINE: Joey? Joey?

(She sees a wall covered in photos of her. Joe Divola enters and shuts the front door.)

ELAINE: Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!

JOE DIVOLA: Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.

ELAINE: You left your door open.

JOE DIVOLA: I know, I like to encourage intruders.

ELAINE: (laughs) What?s all this?

JOE DIVOLA: Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.

ELAINE: Where did you get all these pictures?

JOE DIVOLA: I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.

ELAINE: Showering?

JOE DIVOLA: I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?

ELAINE: In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?

JOE DIVOLA: Why

ELAINE: Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?

JOE DIVOLA: Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?

ELAINE: That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.

JOE DIVOLA: What are you doing here?

ELAINE: Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.

JOE DIVOLA: Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.

ELAINE: Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.

JOE DIVOLA: Really?

ELAINE: Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..

(Divola is blocking the door with his head.)

JOE DIVOLA: You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?

ELAINE: Uh.. I?m Elaine!

JOE DIVOLA: He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.

ELAINE: Oh.

JOE DIVOLA: Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?

ELAINE: Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.

JOE DIVOLA: You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.

ELAINE: Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.

(Divola blocks the door when Elaine tries to leave.)

JOE DIVOLA: Pagliacci kills his wife.

ELAINE: Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown

JOE DIVOLA: You're not leaving

(Elaine sprays Divola in the eyes and he falls on his back. Elaine leaves.)


[JERRY'S APARTMENT.]

JERRY: (on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.

(Knock at door.)

JERRY: (cautiously) Who is it?

GEORGE: It's George.

(George enters wearing a very small tuxedo.)

GEORGE: What, are you locking the door now?

JERRY: Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?

GEORGE: Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.

JERRY: Ooo, that was a bad toast.

GEORGE: It wasn't that bad.

JERRY: I never heard anybody curse in a toast.

GEORGE: I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.

JERRY: There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.

GEORGE: Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.

JERRY: What do you mean not going? why not?

GEORGE: I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.

JERRY: Why doesn't she pay for hers?

GEORGE: That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?

JERRY: It's nice to get a reach.

(Loud thump is heard from the front door.)

JERRY: Who is it?

KRAMER: It's me!

(Kramer is on the floor)

KRAMER: What, are you locking the door now?

JERRY: Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?

KRAMER: I am dressed.

JERRY: You're going like this?

KRAMER: Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.

JERRY: I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!

KRAMER: People do, I don't.

JERRY: Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!

JERRY: Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?

GEORGE: That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!

JERRY: All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.

Kramer is playing opera music

JERRY: Would you turn that down! What is that crap!

KRAMER: It's Pagliacci!

JERRY: Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.

KRAMER: Why? What happened?

JERRY: Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.

KRAMER: That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.

GEORGE: What? Really?

KRAMER: Yeah.

GEORGE: People are looking for tickets here?

KRAMER: What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!

GEORGE: Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.

JERRY: Oh yeah right.

KRAMER: OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.

GEORGE: All right, all right.

JERRY: All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.

GEORGE: Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?

KRAMER: Oh yeah!

(Kramer and George leave.)


[INSIDE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(Opera music is playing, Joe Divola is putting on white clown make up.)


[OUTSIDE THE THEATRE.]

(Jerry and Elaine are waiting.)

JERRY: You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?

ELAINE: Cherry Binaca, it?s new.

JERRY: See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!

ELAINE: It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.

JERRY: Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.

(Jerry drops a coin that he was tossing.)

JERRY: Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.

MAN#1: No it's not, it's mine.

JERRY: I was just flipping it, it's mine.

MAN#1: No, I dropped it, it's mine.

JERRY: All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.

MAN#1: Well it is mine.

JERRY: What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.

(Jerry tears up the dollar.)

MAN#1: You think I care about money, that?s how much I care about money, I don't care about money.

JERRY: Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.

MAN#1: Why don't you get lost.

JERRY: Because I was standing here, that?s why.

MAN#1: Oh Yeah?

JERRY: Yeah!

(The man walks away.)

JERRY: I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?


[IN THE PARK]

(Joe Divola, dressed up in a clown suit is walking through the park.)

PARK GUY#1: Hey clown!

PARK GUY#2: hey clown!

PARK GUY#1: Make us laugh, clown!

PARK GUY#2: Nice face, clown!

PARK GUY#2: Make me laugh, clown!

(Divola kicks them all to the ground.)


[ALLEYWAY]

(Kramer and George are trying to sell the tickets.)

KRAMER: I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.

MAN#2: Hey, hey. Are you selling.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I?m selling.

MAN#2: Where are they?

KRAMER: Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.

MAN#2: What do you want for them.

KRAMER: All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.

MAN#2: I'll give you five hundred for the pair.

GEORGE: Ok, it's a deal!

KRAMER: Pzzzt. No.

GEORGE: No? Are you crazy?

KRAMER: Look, let me handle this.

GEORGE: Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!

KRAMER: You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.

(The man walks away)

GEORGE: Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.

KRAMER: Look, I know what I?m doing here George.

GEORGE: This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah.

GEORGE: Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.

KRAMER: I know where I?m standing.

GEORGE: Alright.

KRAMER: Hey!

GEORGE: (shouting) Get your Paliachi!


[OUTSIDE THEATRE]

JERRY: Where are they already?

ELAINE: I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.

JERRY: Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!

JERRY: Do you remember the curse toast?

ELAINE: Oh yeah, the curse toast.

JERRY: So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.

ELAINE: Me too

JERRY: Crazy Joe Divola

ELAINE: How do you know his name?

JERRY: What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?

ELAINE: I never told you his name.

JERRY: I never told you his name.

ELAINE: Wait a second, who are we talking about here?

JERRY: Joe Divola.

ELAINE: Right, Joe Divola

JERRY: How do you know his name?

ELAINE: I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.

(They click)

JERRY: Oh my god, its Joe Divola

ELAINE: Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?

JERRY: That madman is trying to kill me.

ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!

JERRY: Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!

ELAINE: Oooohh, what about me!

(Divola walks up to them, dressed in the clown suit.)

JOE DIVOLA: Excuse me

ELAINE & JERRY: Aaahhhhh!!


[ALLEYWAY]

(George still hasn't sold the ticket.)

GEORGE: But this is Pavarotti!

MAN#3: Three hundred dollars, that?s a lot of money.

Mr & Mrs Reichman are walking through the alley

MR REICHMAN: You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.

GEORGE: All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.

MR REICHMAN: Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.

GEORGE: Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.

MR REICHMAN: Costanza!?

GEORGE: Mr Reichman?

MR REICHMAN: You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets.

MRS REICHMAN: Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!


[OUTSIDE THE THEATRE]

JOE DIVOLA: Anything is welcome, I accept change.

JERRY: I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.

JOE DIVOLA: You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.

JERRY: I'm telling you, the guy took.....

JOE DIVOLA: And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.

(Mrs Reichman runs past)

MRS REICHMAN: Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!

JOE DIVOLA: What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?

ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.

JOE DIVOLA: You people make me sick.

JERRY: That is one angry clown!


[Middle Monologue]

JERRY: The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"


[Outside The Theatre]

JERRY: (Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!

ELAINE: You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.

JERRY: Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.

JOE DIVOLA: I don't want any money.

ELAINE: I smell cherry.

JOE DIVOLA: It's Binaca.

JERRY: Binaca?

(They see the real clown singing and realize that they are talking to Crazy Joe. They run away.)


[ALLEYWAY]

(George is finalizing the deal.)

GEORGE: What did we say? Two seventy-five?

MAN#3: Two fifty.

GEORGE: Two fifty? Are you sure

MAN#3: Yeah, yeah, I?m sure.

GEORGE: All right, all right, two fifty.

SUSAN: George!

GEORGE: S-Susan

SUSAN: I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.

GEORGE: What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.

SUSAN: Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.

GEORGE: So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?

SUSAN: She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!

GEORGE: Yeah you made it, how about that.

SUSAN: Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.

(George gives the man the ticket and takes the money.)

GEORGE: We get to go to the opera together!

SUSAN: Who's that?

GEORGE: That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.


[ENTRANCE TO THEATER.]

JERRY: Come on, you gotta let us in

USHER: Not without tickets.

JERRY: We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.

USHER: Well that?s a problem. Excuse me.

JERRY: You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.

USHER: A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.

(Kramer slides in.)

JERRY&ELAINE: We're with him, we're with him.

KRAMER: Are you guys ready?

JERRY&ELAINE: Yeah, Yeah!!

KRAMER: Have you seen George?

JERRY: We thought he was with you.

ELAINE: Come on, he's on his own, come on!


[SITTING IN THE THEATER]

KRAMER: These are great seats huh?

ELAINE: Yeah

KRAMER: Yeah

JERRY: Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.

ELAINE: Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?

JERRY: She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.

ELAINE: Nedda?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Oh my god..

(Man #3 enters and shuffles to his seat.)

MAN#3: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

(Susan comes in from the other side.)

JERRY: Susan! What are you doing here?

SUSAN: My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.

JERRY: Where's George?

MAN#3: I got his ticket.

SUSAN: He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.

JERRY: Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?

MAN#3: One seventy-five.

JERRY: Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?

KRAMER: Some nut in a clown suit!

(The show starts, everyone claps except Elaine and Jerry who look very frightened.)


[Closing Monologue]

JERRY: I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.

[Jerry and George talking near a bar.]

JERRY: We're dead.

GEORGE: We're not dead.

JERRY: We are dead.

GEORGE: Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.

JERRY: All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.

GEORGE: So we'll do it tomorrow.

JERRY: Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?

GEORGE: About six years ago.

JERRY: I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.

GEORGE: Women like skiers.

JERRY: So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.

GEORGE: Yeah. Right.

JERRY: Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.

GEORGE: The closet business? What's the closet business?

JERRY: What is it your business?

GEORGE: I'm interested.

JERRY: She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.

GEORGE: So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Yeah. So what happened?

JERRY: So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.

MARLA: (Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.

JERRY: George, Marla.

GEORGE: Marla.

MARLA: George. Jerry, Stacey.

JERRY: Stacey.

STACEY: Jerry.

JERRY: George, Stacey.

GEORGE: Stacey.

STACEY: George.

JERRY: George.

GEORGE: Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)

MARLA: So, how was your trip to Berlin?

JERRY: Trip to Berlin?

MARLA: Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.

JERRY: Oh, right, right.

MARLA: The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.

JERRY: Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"

MARLA: You, know my boyfriend went.

JERRY: Really?

MARLA: Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.

JERRY: Oh, did he like it?

MARLA: I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)

GEORGE: Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.

STACEY: Wow, what a great job. A writer.

GEORGE: Not a bad way to make a buck.

STACEY: Sounds great.

GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)


[Jerry and George at Monk's]

JERRY: So, are you gonna go out with her?

GEORGE: I might.

JERRY: What about Susan?

GEORGE: What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?

JERRY: Depends.

GEORGE: Depends on what?

JERRY: On many factors.

GEORGE: Like what?

JERRY: Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?

GEORGE: No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.

JERRY: What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?

GEORGE: Implied.

JERRY: She got anything in your medicine cabinet?

GEORGE: There might be some moisturizer.

JERRY: Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?

GEORGE: (Pause) Yeah.

JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: You got yourself a girlfriend.

GEORGE: Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?

JERRY: I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...

GEORGE: Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.

JERRY: You're going to make a good father someday.

GEORGE: Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.

JERRY: Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?

GEORGE: No, what?

JERRY: The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.

GEORGE: Why? What do you mean?

JERRY: Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?

GEORGE: Oh, right. Oh no, man.

JERRY: you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.

JERRY: (sarcastically) Oh, yeah.

GEORGE: Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.

JERRY: This is your plan?

GEORGE: No, no. I'm just thinking.

JERRY: I don't think you are.


[Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.]

MARLA: Let me tell you what I think.

JERRY: Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.

MARLA: Are you very fussy about your pants?

JERRY: I don't think I am.

MARLA: Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?

JERRY: Try me.

MARLA: Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.

JERRY: Everything?

MARLA: Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.

JERRY: You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: This is not a good time.

KRAMER: Five minutes. What?

JERRY: What did you have to give your TV away to George for?

KRAMER: Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.

JERRY: Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)

KRAMER: Well, wow.

JERRY: Marla, Kramer.

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Why don't you go out? It's nice out.

KRAMER: Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.

JERRY: There's weather.

KRAMER: Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.

JERRY: I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.

KRAMER: No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?

JERRY: I don't know.

KRAMER: Will you tape it?

JERRY: Kramer... (points to Marla)

KRAMER: Yeah. (He exits)

JERRY: So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.

MARLA: Never came back.

JERRY: Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.

MARLA: It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.

JERRY: Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?

ELAINE: I didn't get it.

JERRY: Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.

MARLA: Well, he wanted me to move in with him.

JERRY: Snapple?

MARLA: No thanks.

JERRY: Go on.

MARLA: Well I wouldn't move in because...

JERRY: Yes.

MARLA: Well because...

JERRY: Yeah.

MARLA: Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Hello!

JERRY: Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.

ELAINE: I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.

JERRY: Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.

ELAINE: I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.

MARLA: I should be going.

ELAINE: No, no, I'm leaving.

JERRY: I like that thing in your hair there.

ELAINE: Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?

MARLA: No thanks.

ELAINE: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.

MARLA: I should be going.

JERRY: So we'll talk about the hooks then?

MARLA: Yes. (She exits)

ELAINE: What? Was it something I said?

JERRY: She's a virgin, she just told me.

ELAINE: Well I didn't know.

JERRY: Well it's not like spotting a toupee.

ELAINE: Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?

JERRY: No, no, I mean...

ELAINE: 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)

JERRY: Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?

GEORGE: It's George.


[Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.]

GEORGE: She's a virgin?

JERRY: A virgin.

GEORGE: Wow. So what're you gonna do?

JERRY: I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.

GEORGE: I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.

JERRY: You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.

GEORGE: You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.

JERRY: Yeah, me too.

GEORGE: We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?

JERRY: All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.

KRAMER: I'm in. Let's go for it.

GEORGE: What do you want?

KRAMER: I don't care, whatever.

GEORGE: I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.

KRAMER: Okay. What are you getting?

GEORGE: I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.

KRAMER: What's a Chow Fung?

GEORGE: It's a broad noodle.

KRAMER: What do you mean, a broad noodle?

GEORGE: It's a big flat noodle.

KRAMER: Well I don't want a big flat noodle.

GEORGE: What kind of noodle do you want?

KRAMER: Who says I want a noodle?

GEORGE: All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.

KRAMER: All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.

GEORGE: Fine.

KRAMER: Get extra MSG.


[Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.]

ELAINE: Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.

MARLA: So they just leave?

ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.

MARLA: Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.

ELAINE: Eh.


[Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.]

JERRY: All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.

GEORGE: Where's the food? What happened to Ping?

JERRY: Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.

GEORGE: Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.

JERRY: Your butler?

GEORGE: Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.

JERRY: What about me?

GEORGE: Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)

JERRY: (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?

ELAINE: There was a bit of an accident.

PING: Head hurts. Head really hurts.

JERRY: What happened?

ELAINE: Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.

GEORGE: Something happened to the food?

PING: I only saved one bag.

JERRY: Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?

MARLA: I'll get some ice.

GEORGE: (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey, you got the food?

JERRY: Yeah, here.

KRAMER: What took you so long? Hey, Ping!

PING: Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)

KRAMER: Yeah. Where's yours?

GEORGE: He dropped it.

KRAMER: Oh, that's too bad.

ELAINE: You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.

PING: No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.

KRAMER: (To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?

ELAINE: (To Ping) I did not jaywalk.

JERRY: (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.

PING: (To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.

KRAMER: (To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.

PING: (To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?

KRAMER: (To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.


[George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.]

JERRY: A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!

GEORGE: All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.

JERRY: What do you mean? They know we're here.

GEORGE: I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.

JERRY: No, no, would you get up?

GEORGE: I can do this, Jerry.

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)

(Woman enters.)

WOMAN: Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)

JERRY: Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)

MAN #1: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.

RITA: Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.

JERRY: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?

RITA: He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.

JERRY: Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)

RITA: Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.

MAN #2: Where's George?

JERRY: Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.

SUSAN: David Letterman's on the floor?

JERRY: Yeah, he just walked by.

RITA: Well, I think we should get started anyway.

JERRY: Yeah, good idea.

RITA: So how are you guys comin' along?

JERRY: Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.

RITA: Good. (Pause)

JERRY: Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?

RITA: So that's the idea?

JERRY: Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.

MAN #2: Those collars are funny!

MAN #1: Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters)

GEORGE: You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?

RITA: I'm Rita Kearson.

GEORGE: Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.

JERRY: Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.


[Jerry and George enter Jerry's place to see Kramer watching (and playing) Jeopardy.]

JERRY: So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?

GEORGE: No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.

KRAMER: You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.

JERRY: Would you give him the TV back?

KRAMER: Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.

GEORGE: I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)

KRAMER: (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!

SUSAN: Hello?

GEORGE: Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?

SUSAN: What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!

GEORGE: Fired? Why?

SUSAN: Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.

KRAMER: (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.

GEORGE: But I had no... I didn't realize.

SUSAN: You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!

GEORGE: I just feel terrible This is just terrible.

KRAMER: (To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.

SUSAN: I'll speak to you later.

GEORGE: (Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!

JERRY: Why did he fire her?

GEORGE: Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!

KRAMER: What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!

JERRY: You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.

GEORGE: Another job?

JERRY: Couple of interviews.

GEORGE: Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.


[Jerry and Marla are making out in his closet.]

MARLA: Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.

JERRY: What? Leave? Where? Why?

MARLA: You know, the apartment.

JERRY: Why would I leave? This is my apartment.

MARLA: Well what if it was my apartment?

JERRY: Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?

MARLA: Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.

JERRY: Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.

MARLA: Maybe I should get going.


[Jerry and Elaine at a bar.]

JERRY: What else did you say to her?

ELAINE: Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.

JERRY: More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.

ELAINE: Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.

JERRY: What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?

ELAINE: You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.

JERRY: I was trying to be.

ELAINE: Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?

JERRY: Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.

ELAINE: Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.


[Cut over to George and a woman]

GEORGE: What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.

WOMAN: A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.

CAROL: A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)

WOMAN: A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!

[Setting: Monk's Coffee shop] 

(Jerry and Kramer are sitting opposite Elaine at a booth, eating lunch) 

JERRY: (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question. 

ELAINE: Mm-hm. 

JERRY: You're a hostage, captured by terrorists- 

ELAINE: (Smiling, chewing) Who, me? 

JERRY: You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry? 

ELAINE: (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention. 

KRAMER: (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off! 

(Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state) 

KRAMER: Hey, Georgie. 

JERRY AND ELAINE: Hi. 

(George sits down next to Elaine - opposite Kramer) 

JERRY: (To George) What's the matter? 

GEORGE: (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me. 

JERRY: "Caught" you? Doing what? 

GEORGE: You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone.. 

ELAINE: (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?! 

GEORGE: (Nods) Uh-huh. 

KRAMER: (Laughing) She caught you? 

(Elaine laughs with Kramer) 

JERRY: Where? 

GEORGE: (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it.. 

JERRY: "Glamour"? 

(Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly) 

GEORGE: ..So, one thing lead to another.. 

JERRY: So, what did she do? 

GEORGE: First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it. 

KRMAER: (Reflecting on the story so far) Man.. 

GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up. 

JERRY: What did you do? 

GEORGE: I zipped up! 

ELAINE: (Wide-eyed) So, she fell? 

GEORGE: Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was! 

ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have.. 

JERRY: (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so. 

ELAINE: (Finishing it off) ..done that. 

GEORGE: So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital. 

ELAINE: (Between chuckles) How is she? 

GEORGE: (Somewhat angered) She's in traction. 

ELAINE: (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry. 

GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine. 

ELAINE: (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious. 

GEORGE: Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!" 

(Kramer laughs, sipping his drink) 

JERRY: "Glamour"? 

(Elaine laughs) 

GEORGE: (Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again. 

ELAINE: What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together? 

GEORGE: (Definite) All together. 

(The next three lines are said at the exact same time) 

ELAINE: Oh, gimme a break.. 

JERRY: (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right. 

KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop? 

JERRY AND ELAINE: C'mon.. 

GEORGE: You don't think I can? 

JERRY: No chance. 

GEORGE: (Daring) You think you could? 

JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you. 

GEORGE: Care to make it interesting? 

JERRY: Sure, how much? 

GEORGE: A hundred dollars. 

JERRY: (Pointing) You're on. 

KRAMER: (Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue) 

JERRY: You? 

KRAMER: Yeah. 

JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check. 

ELAINE: (Smiling) I want to be in on this, too. 

GEORGE AND JERRY: (Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no.. 

ELAINE: Why? 

JERRY: (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges.. 

ELAINE: What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why? 

JERRY: Because you're a woman! 

ELAINE: So what? 

JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man. 

ELAINE: (Sarcastic) Oh. 

JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving. 

ELAINE: Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs. 

KRAMER: (Making a point) Not everyday. 

GEORGE: Alright, look, you want to be in? 

ELAINE: Yeah! 

GEORGE: You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars. 

KRAMER: No, a thousand! 

ELAINE: No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty. 

GEORGE: Alright, you're in for one-fifty. 

JERRY: (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty. 

GEORGE: Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing? 

JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. 

KRAMER: Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table) 

(Jerry, Elaine, and George all hook their pinkies onto his, in a 'pinkie promise', they all pull their hand away, yelling out "Yeah!") 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's apartment] 

(Jerry's sitting on the couch, eating cereal while George is on the phone with his mother) 

GEORGE: (Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts) 

JERRY: (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah? 

GEORGE: (Defensively) Whatever. 

(Intercom buzzes, Jerry gets up to answer it) 

JERRY: How is she? 

GEORGE: (Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight. 

JERRY: (Answering to the intercom) Yeah? 

ELAINE: It's me. 

JERRY: Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door) 

GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing tonight? 

JERRY: (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla. 

GEORGE: Oh, the virgin? 

JERRY: Yeah. 

GEORGE: Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest? 

JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead. 

(Kramer enters, heading for Jerry's window) 

KRAMER: Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street. 

(George and Jerry quickly join him at the window) 

JERRY: Where? 

KRAMER: Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left? 

GEORGE: (In awe) Wow! 

JERRY: (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?! 

(All eyes are glued to the woman) 

GEORGE: (Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people.. 

KRAMER: ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him) 

JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room? 

GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked. 

JERRY: What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too? 

GEORGE: (Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama. 

(Elaine enters) 

ELAINE: Hey. 

JERRY AND GEORGE: (Only turning back for a second) Hey. 

ELAINE: Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved? 

JERRY: (Over his shoulder) Not me. 

GEORGE: (Also, over his shoulder) Not me. 

ELAINE: What're you looking at? 

JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street. 

ELAINE: (Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight. 

JERRY: (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back. 

ELAINE: (Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars. 

JERRY: (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh. 

GEORGE: Have a good time. 

(Kramer casually enters, takes a few step toward the kitchen, and slaps a wad of bills onto the counter) 

KRAMER: (Declaring) I'm out! 

(Kramer now has the attention of everyone in the room. Jerry's mouth is open in shock. A moment passes) 

ELAINE: What?! 

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest. 

GEORGE: You're out?! 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what? 

ELAINE: Well, that was fast! 

JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him) 

(Jerry, Elaine, and George all look at each other, reflecting) 

ELAINE: ..And then there were three. 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Hospital room] 

(Estelle is on a hospital bed. George, sitting back in a chair, is visiting her) 

ESTELLE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park! 

GEORGE: (Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma. 

ESTELLE: Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open. 

GEORGE: Ma, people can hear you. 

ESTELLE: (Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star! 

GEORGE: (Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough! 

ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist. 

GEORGE: No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist! 

ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go? 

GEORGE: (Like a kid) Because I don't want to. 

ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody. 

GEORGE: Well, I am not going. 

ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago. 

(George's cousin, Shelly, enters) 

SHELLY: Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen? 

GEORGE: (Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?! 

(On the other side of a curtain divider, the silhouette of a shapely nurse can be seen entering) 

NURSE: Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath. 

(The shadow of a patient awakening can be seen) 

DENISE: Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep. 

(The two women go about preparing the sponge bath. George is visibly affected - breathing heavily, and staring at them through the curtain) 

SHELLY: (Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing? 

GEORGE: (Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television. 

(The patient, Denise, is trying to get her gown off) 

NURSE: Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head.. 

DENISE: Oh.. thank you. 

SHELLY: (Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized) What is it you're doing, exactly? 

(A moment passes. George seems not to have heard his cousin) 

ESTELLE: George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you! 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: New York Health Club] 

(Elaine, dressed for a work-out, is signing forms while talking with her friend, Joyce) 

JOYCE: So, when was the last time you took a class? 

ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while. 

JOYCE: (Overly excited) Are you psyched? 

ELAINE: (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched. 

JOYCE: Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here. 

ELAINE: Why is that? 

JOYCE: (Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts? 

(Elaine looks over, and her jaw drops to the floor. Breathless, she turns back to her friend) 

ELAINE: (Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here! 

JOYCE: He's gonna be in your class today. 

ELAINE: (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?! 

JOYCE: I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt. 

ELAINE: Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt. 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's car] 

(Stationary, Jerry's girlfriend, Marla, and him are making out. After some deep kissing, Marla breaks away) 

MARLA: Let's slow it down a little. 

JERRY: "Slow it down"? 

MARLA: Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know.. 

JERRY: Ah, yeah.. I know. 

MARLA: You're okay with that, right? 

JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that. 

MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night, then? 

JERRY: (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night. 

MARLA: Alright, then. Good night. 

JERRY: Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's bedroom] 

(Jerry, in the middle of the night, is moving around - unable to get to sleep, he's restless. Scene cuts to George. He's wide awake, and staring at the ceiling. Cut to 

Elaine. She's settling into bed, unable to get to sleep. The scene takes a final cut to Kramer. He's sound asleep) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's apartment] 

(Jerry's in a grouchy mood. Kramer enters) 

KRAMER: (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng! 

JERRY: (Out of it) Yeah, good morning. 

KRAMER: Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window) 

JERRY: She's not there. She's doin' her wash. 

KRAMER: (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night? 

JERRY: (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did! 

KRAMER: So, you're still master of your domain. 

JERRY: (Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down! 

KRAMER: Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say? 

JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give! 

KRAMER: Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it. 

JERRY: (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way. 

KRAMER: (Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think: "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?! 

JERRY: Look, I'm sorry- 

KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry. 

JERRY: Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way! 

KRAMER: (Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please! 

(A pause as Jerry thinks it over) 

JERRY: Alright.. (Takes his coat off) 

KRAMER: Yes! 

JERRY: ..Alright. 

KRAMER: (Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window) 

JERRY: She's not there! 

KRAMER: Oh, I can wait.. 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Monk's Coffee shop] 

(Jerry and George are sitting opposite each other in a booth) 

JERRY: So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath? 

GEORGE: Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts. 

JERRY: Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital. 

GEORGE: (Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry.. 

(Jerry nods) 

JERRY: (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain? 

GEORGE: (Arms out) I am king of the county. You? 

JERRY: Lord of the manor. 

(Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry) 

ELAINE: John F. Kennedy Jun-ya! 

JERRY: What? 

ELAINE: (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class. 

JERRY: Really? Did you talk to him? 

ELAINE: No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout." 

GEORGE: "Quite a workout"? What did you say? 

ELAINE: (Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah." 

JERRY: (Adding, fake praise) Good one. 

ELAINE: So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God.. 

JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain? 

ELAINE: (Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Estelle's hospital room] 

(George quickly runs in, turning around - he checks both his watch and the wall clock. He smiles to himself) 

ESTELLE: You're back. 

GEORGE: Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit. 

ESTELLE: I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this. 

GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you? 

ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich.. 

GEORGE: (Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation) 

ESTELLE: (Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak. 

GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference? 

ESTELLE: I don't understand why you can't do this for me! 

GEORGE: (Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you. 

ESTELLE: But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over! 

GEORGE: Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs. 

ESTELLE: Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came. 

(Nurse enters) 

NURSE: (To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath. 

(George eagerly takes his seat, looking up at their shadows on the divider) 

ESTELLE: George.. I'm huuunnnggry! 

GEORGE: (Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on.. 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: New York Health Club] 

(Elaine, dressed to impress, walks up to the counter. She's obviously looking around for JFK Jr.) 

JOYCE: Hi! 

ELAINE: Hi. 

JOYCE: Did you get your hair done today? 

ELAINE: No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath) 

JOYCE: You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday. 

ELAINE: (Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression? 

JOYCE: Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away) 

(Elaine violently grabs her jacket, pulling Joyce back in her direction) 

ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?! 

JOYCE: (Uneasy) He asked about you. 

ELAINE: (Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say? 

JOYCE: He wanted to know your situation. 

ELAINE: (Quick) What situation? I have a situation? 

JOYCE: I-I told him you were single. 

ELAINE: That was good. That was very good. 

JOYCE: He said you were just his type. 

ELAINE: (Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me. 

JOYCE: He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello. 

(Breathless, Elaine almost collapses) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's apartment] 

(Kramer's at the window while Jerry's on the phone with his mother, watching TV) 

JERRY: Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up) 

KRAMER: (Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes.. 

JERRY: (Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus.. 

(Kramer joins in with Jerry, only, he has a different version) 

KRAMER: The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on.. 

(Both Kramer and Jerry continue to sing the two different versions, trying to over ride the other) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: George's room] 

(George is wide awake, staring at the ceiling. Scene cuts to Jerry. Once again, he's restless and flings the covers off him. Scene cuts to Kramer - he's out like a light. The scene takes a final cut to Elaine. Foreshadowing the next scene, she's sound asleep too) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's apartment] 

(Jerry and George. They're bickering at each other due to the lack of sex) 

GEORGE: All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee? 

JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?! 

ELAINE: (Through intercom) It's Elaine. 

JERRY: (Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine) 

GEORGE: Where did you get those socks? 

JERRY: I don't know. 

GEORGE: I think those are my socks! 

JERRY: How are these your socks?! 

GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore! 

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them! 

GEORGE: Yeah, well, they're my socks! 

JERRY: They're my socks! 

(A brief moment passes as they look at each other) 

GEORGE: Oh boy.. 

JERRY: What are we doing here.. 

GEORGE: ..Oh boy. 

JERRY: This is ridiculous. 

GEORGE: Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting. 

JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody. 

GEORGE: Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street. 

(Elaine slowly enters, shutting the door behind her) 

ELAINE: Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up) 

GEORGE: (Shocked) You caved?! 

JERRY: It's over? 

GEORGE: You're out? 

JERRY: Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead. 

(Elaine sets the bills down on the counter) 

GEORGE: I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring. 

JERRY: What happened? 

ELAINE: It was..uh.. John-John. 

JERRY AND GEORGE: Ohhhhh.. John-John. 

JERRY: But you made it through the day before. 

ELAINE: Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight. 

JERRY: Why outside here? 

ELAINE: Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up. 

(George picks up the money, counting it) 

JERRY: Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me. 

GEORGE: And then, (Smacks the money) there were two. 

ELAINE: (Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior.. 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's apartment] 

(Jerry and Marla are making out on the couch) 

MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom. 

JERRY: Really? 

MARLA: Yes. 

JERRY: You sure? 

MARLA: Yes. 

JERRY: You really want to? 

MARLA: I do. I'm ready. 

JERRY: Okay.. 

MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you. 

JERRY: (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it. 

(They both laugh slightly) 

MARLA: What do you mean? 

JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but.. 

(Scene cuts to Elaine on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She checks her watch. Scene cuts back to Jerry's apartment. Marla, obviously upset, is putting her coat on) 

MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends? 

JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother- 

MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind. 

(She leaves, slamming the door. Jerry hangs his head, then directs his attention to his window. Eagerly walking over, he sits in his chair, staring at the woman) 


[Scene cuts to Elaine. Marla walks out in front of her, trying to hail a taxi]

ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you- 

MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible. 

Horrible! All of you! 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Jerry's apartment] 

ELAINE: What happened? 

JERRY: I told her about the contest. 

ELAINE: Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o. 

(George enters) 

GEORGE: (To Elaine) Hey, what happened? 

ELAINE: What? 

GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy. 

ELAINE: (Let down) He didn't show. 

GEORGE: Yeah, he did. 

ELAINE: What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go.. 

GEORGE: No, no, no. He just left. 

ELAINE: What? 

GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla. 

JERRY: Marla? 

GEORGE: Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away. 

ELAINE: (Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin? 

GEORGE: Yeah. 

ELAINE: They drove away? 

GEORGE: Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's- 

JERRY: (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven! 

(All three crowd around the window) 

ELAINE: (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..? 

GEORGE: Kramer?! 

(A brief pause) 

ELAINE: He's waving.. 

(All three wave back) 

(Scene ends) 


[Setting: Elaine's bedroom] 

(Elaine's sound asleep. Scene cuts to George, then Jerry. They too, are sleeping. Scene takes a cut to Kramer and the nudist - both asleep; then a final cut to Marla's bedroom. She's sleeping with JFK Jr) 

MARLA: Ohh, John. That was wonderful.. 

(Scene ends)

...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem ``There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!''.


[Open with Jerry and Elaine in a car on their way to the airport. Elaine is singing a poppy Jazz tune.]

ELAINE: Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...

JERRY: Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?

(They both chortle, and Jerry is hot so he's taking his coat off, but Elaine refuses to take the wheel and Jerry's hand gets stuck and before you can say "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", they collide head-on with a Snapple truck....)

ELAINE: Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.

JERRY: I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?

ELAINE: Gimme ten bucks and find out...

JERRY: So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...

ELAINE: Yeah, worked out good.

JERRY: And here's the beauty--

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: George is pickin' us up at the airport.

ELAINE: Get out of here! Why?

JERRY: You know that awning outside my building?

ELAINE: Yeah...

JERRY: He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.

ELAINE: So what happened?

JERRY: He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.

ELAINE: Hey, how we doin' on time?

JERRY: Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...

ELAINE: Hey! Wait up!

JERRY: Hey! Wait up!

DRIVER: Sorry. Heh heh heh...

(The driver speeds away without our heroes, and he seems pretty happy about it. )

(Finally inside, they check their luggage... )

SKYCAP: Where you goin'?

JERRY: Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?

ELAINE: Yeah, you want five?

JERRY: Gimme ten.

ELAINE: You're giving him *ten* dollars?

JERRY: Well, we got three bags.

ELAINE: That's a pretty big tip...

JERRY: That's what they get!

ELAINE: They don't get that much.

JERRY: Let's ask him.

ELAINE: We can't ask him...

JERRY: Let's see what he says.

ELAINE: Jerry, we don't have time for this...

JERRY: Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.

SKYCAP: Depends on the person, depends on the bag.

JERRY: Uh, how about a couple of people like us.

SKYCAP: People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing...

JERRY: C'mon, seriously...

SKYCAP: Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag.

ELAINE: What!?

SKYCAP: That's right.

ELAINE: *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.

SKYCAP: Look, you asked, I told you.

ELAINE: You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...

JERRY: All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...

ELAINE: You're lucky I don't report you...

SKYCAP: JFK...

SKYCAP: ...Honolulu.

ELAINE: Wait up!

JERRY: You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!

JERRY & ELAINE: The flight's been canceled?!?!

TICKET LADY: Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.

JERRY: We'll take 'em!

ELAINE: We're not going to sit together?

JERRY: Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.

ELAINE: Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.

JERRY: We'll call him...

ELAINE: There's no time.

JERRY: No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?

TICKET LADY: There's no time.

JERRY: There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.

TICKET LADY: I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.

(The two have that uncomfortable politeness that only comes about when you're down to the last piece of pizza. Jerry breaks the silence:)

JERRY: I'll take the first class.

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Why should you get the first class?

JERRY: Elaine, have you ever flown first class?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...

ELAINE: You flew here coach.

JERRY: Yeah, that's a point...

ELAINE: All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.

(They board the plane, and the flight attendant "welcomes" Elaine aboard.)

ATTENDANT #1: Third row right...

(Then Mr. First class Jerry comes aboard.)

ATTENDANT #1: Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard.

JERRY: Bon voyage, Lainey!

(Elaine is robbed of her peek into the first class section by a drawn curtain and she goes to her seat. However, someone comes after her and:)

PASSENGER #1: Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're sitting in my seat...

(Elaine moves over, and he moves in. The guy's got like 5 bags and Laptop.)

PASSENGER #1: I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.

ELAINE: Great... [To herself] Help me...

(Jerry gets to his seat, however, he also is in the wrong seat:)

TIA: Excuse me, I think you're in my seat...

JERRY: Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!


[George and Kramer in the car.]

GEORGE: Hey, thanks for coming with me.

KRAMER: Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?

GEORGE: I confused it with another awning.

KRAMER: So how we doin' on time?

GEORGE: We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!

KRAMER: Will you relax?!

GEORGE: Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!

KRAMER: This is the best way to go!

GEORGE: Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...

KRAMER: George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...

GEORGE: Really?

KRAMER: If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.

GEORGE: The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?

KRAMER: Duty.

GEORGE: Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?

KRAMER: No, I dunno how much duty is.

GEORGE: Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...

KRAMER: I still like to stop at the duty free shop.

GEORGE: I like to stop at the duty free shop.

(They start to "sing", growing more excited after each iteration:)

GEORGE & KRAMER: I like to stop at the duty free shop!

I like to stop at the duty free shop!


[Meanwhile, back on the plane, Jerry and Tia are chatting (isn't that always the way? You get stuck beside someone who insists on going on and on about their kids and how their life didn't go according to plan and all that boring dreck...]

TIA: So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''...

JERRY: Oh my...

TIA: Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.

JERRY: Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?

TIA: See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?

JERRY: Uh-huh...


[In traffic, Kramer and George are surrounded by honking cars and what is obviously heavy traffic]

KRAMER: How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...


[Back in, ugh, *coach* (those heathens), the annoying guy is sleeping beside her while the woman on her other side is reading a book. Elaine is looking rather, shall we say "pensive". She talks to herself]

ELAINE: Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.


[On the bright side, Kramer and George arrive at the airport. They're running to the terminal:

GEORGE: They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!

KRAMER: Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!

(They find an arrival/departure screen)

GEORGE: Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.

KRAMER: No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.

GEORGE: Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!

KRAMER: Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.

(A bearded man comes up to the screen before they go)

GROSSBARD: Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30... [He leaves]

KRAMER: Did you see that guy?

GEORGE: No... What guy?

KRAMER: That guy.. He was just...

GEORGE: Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!

KRAMER: [still lost] I know that guy...

(We cut to the airport gift shop where a man in handcuffs and shackles is being led around by two FBI-looking types)

PRISONER: Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.

GUARD: Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.

(George lifts the last copy from the rack before the con can get it.)

PRISONER: Hey, I was gonna take that!

GEORGE: Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.

PRISONER: I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...

GEORGE: You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!

PRISONER: A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!

GUARD: All right, let's go...

(George checks out the cover shot which shows a picture of the aforementioned prisoner with the caption ``Caught!'' written below.)

PRISONER: I want the magazine!

GEORGE: Umm... No.

PRISONER: You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...

GEORGE: But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!

(Kramer comes into the gift shop and does a Krameresque double-take at "that guy" from the departure screen who's browsing books. He goes up to George.)

KRAMER: They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.

GEORGE: Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...

KRAMER: Where do I know that guy from?


[Elaine is still pining for the guy next to her to wake up so she can go to the bathroom.]

ELAINE: [To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...

(Elaine scurries off to the bathroom, Jerry and Tia are enjoying some hot towels on their faces.)

JERRY: Oh my... that *is* refreshing...

ATTENDANT: Would you care for some slippers?

JERRY: Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?

TIA: Please!

JERRY: Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.

(They chortle to themselves and tink glasses (no, that's not a cleverly- masked euphemism). Back in the car...)

GEORGE: My name is not mentioned in this blurb...

KRAMER: It's Grossbard!

GEORGE: Who's Grossbard?

KRAMER: When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!

GEORGE: Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...

KRAMER: No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...

GEORGE: No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.


[Elaine is still waiting to get into the bathroom-- there's someone in there. *Finally*, a ZZ Top reject comes out of the bathroom and, to paraphrase Jerry in "The Smelly Car": ``I open the door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me--''. Elaine takes in a lungful of air and goes in. Brave little soldier.]


[Jerry comes back from the *first class* washroom]

JERRY: Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.

ATTENDANT: They're gardenias, mostly.

JERRY: I thought I smelled lilac.

ATTENDANT: Yes, there are a few of those, too...

TIA: It's almost overwhelming...

(The captain interrupts)

CAPTAIN: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...

(Elaine exits the bathroom, exasperated and curiou)

ELAINE: [To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?


[Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia; George has been inside to see if Jerry and Elaine are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer in the car.]

GEORGE: Well, You're not gonna believe it...

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.

KRAMER: Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.

(Kramer peels out.)


[In first class, Jerry and Tia get the lowdown on the grub]

ATTENDANT: We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.

JERRY: Oh, saffron! That sounds good.

ATTENDANT: And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...

JERRY & TIA: Tuscany!

(They do that "tink" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the unwashed masses in coach and he's in her way.)

ELAINE: Hi. Can I get to my seat?

ATTENDANT: You're just gonna have to wait...

ELAINE: But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...

ATTENDANT: You're not supposed to get up during the food service.

ELAINE: Well, nobody *told* me that!

ATTENDANT: Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.


[Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)]

GEORGE: There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.

KRAMER: Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!

GEORGE: How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.

KRAMER: Gimme your credit card.

GEORGE: My credit card?

KRAMER: Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.

GEORGE: I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!

KRAMER: I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.

GEORGE: What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.

KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.

GEORGE: This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.


[Back in coach, Elaine returns to her seat now that the attendant is done serving.]

ELAINE: Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...

PASSENGER #1: You're not supposed to get up during the food service.

ELAINE: I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?

PASSENGER #1: He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats.

ELAINE: Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.

ATTENDANT: Are you sure?

ELAINE: Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.

ATTENDANT: Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.

ELAINE: Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.

PASSENGER #1: I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something.

PASSENGER #2: No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig.

PASSENGER #1: They don't eat pigs!

PASSENGER #2: They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.

PASSENGER #3: Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal.

ELAINE: Then why didn't you take it?

PASSENGER #3: I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.

ELAINE: You're eating my food!

ATTENDANT: Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not.


[Jerry and Tia enjoy a dessert treat]

JERRY & TIA: Mmmmmmmm!

TIA: This is the best sundae I've ever had.

JERRY: Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.

TIA: I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.

JERRY: Thank you...

JERRY & TIA: Mmmmmm!

(We get a quick shot of Elaine staring at *something* on the end of her fork with a decidedly unimpressed look. Back in first class)

ATTENDANT: More anything?

JERRY: More everything!


[Back at JFK]

KRAMER: Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.

GEORGE: Super Savers? Are they refundable!?

GEORGE: You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!

KRAMER: She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.

GEORGE: Do you know how much this is going to cost me?

KRAMER: Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you

GEORGE: Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...

(Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of ``Just a minute'' from the occupant inside (I bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?)


[Elaine sneaks into first class. She just gets settled into a comfy seat complete with pillow, when all of a sudden]

ATTENDANT: Excuse me... Excuuuse me...

ELAINE: What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.

ATTENDANT: What is your name?

ELAINE: Elaine Benes?

ATTENDANT: [Checks her list] You're going to have to go back to coach.

ELAINE: No, but there was nobody sitting here...

ATTENDANT: Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.

ELAINE: Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!

ATTENDANT: You're going to have to go back to your seat!

ELAINE: Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!

(The outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket and napping)

JERRY: What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?

ATTENDANT: Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class.

JERRY: Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.

(They return to snuggling)


[Kramer is being escorted through the airport by a security guy. He tries to talk his way out]

KRAMER: Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!

(He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly escapes.)


[Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms flailing out on the runway. He takes a second look, just to be sure.]

JERRY: Couldn't be...

(After they get off the plane, Jerry & Elaine look for the boys and get their baggage)

JERRY: Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.

ELAINE: Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...


[In Honolulu, Elaine's bag appears to be having a good time, revolving around the baggage thingy, complete with lei.]

ELAINE: The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.

JERRY: Yeah, me too...

(He seems so sincere. Tia walks by, along with an entourage of photographers.)

TIA: I'll call you.

JERRY: Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...

(Enter the K-man through the ramp where the baggage comes out)

KRAMER: You guys ready?

JERRY: Yeah. Where's George?

[We go to a shot outside the plane looking in on a rather roughed up George Costanza. He screams]

GEORGE: (can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!


[Ending Monologue]

But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is "standby", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby-- you stand there going ``Bye!'' So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference, I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going ``Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?'' It's like, 'Who the Hell are you?!''

[Jerry's Apartment]

GEORGE: I loved her Jerry, I loved her.

JERRY: No, you didn't.

GEORGE: And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.

JERRY: No she didn't.

GEORGE: What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?

ELAINE: [OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.

GEORGE: Who says?

ELAINE: You did.

GEORGE: Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.

JERRY: You walk around with no underwear?

GEORGE: Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?

JERRY: I do a wash.

GEORGE: Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.

JERRY: When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.

GEORGE: I loved her!

JERRY: You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.

GEORGE: I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.

GEORGE: I gotta call her. Should I call her?

JERRY: George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?

GEORGE: Whyie?

JERRY: You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.

GEORGE: I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.

JERRY: No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.

ELAINE: Dana Folley.

JERRY: Right, Dana Folley.

GEORGE: She any good?

ELAINE: Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?

GEORGE: Wa, uh, ...

ELAINE: Tia? Who's that?

JERRY: She's the model I met on the plane.

ELAINE: She sent you a Christmas card?

JERRY: Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.

GEORGE: My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!

(They ignore George)

JERRY: What are you doing?

ELAINE: ... date with Fred.

JERRY: The religious guy?

ELAINE: He's not THAT religious.

JERRY: Let us pray.

(Kramer Enters)

KRAMER: Hey, you got any Double Crunch?

JERRY: Yeah.

JERRY: Kramer, should I call Susan?

KRAMER: Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.

GEORGE: My little man doesn't know.

KRAMER: The little man knows all.

GEORGE: My little man's an idiot.

ELAINE: See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.

KRAMER: You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...

GEORGE: She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.

ELAINE: No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.

KRAMER: No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.

GEORGE: She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.

KRAMER: All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.

ELAINE: Really? Can you really take a picture?

JERRY: Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.

ELAINE: All right, ha ha

KRAMER: I don't know about that outfit though.

ELAINE: Why? What's wrong with it?

KRAMER: Well, we'll have to improvise.

(Elaine and Kramer exit)

GEORGE: (singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...

JERRY: George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
 

[Change of Scene Tia at Jerry's]

JERRY: So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.

TIA: Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?

JERRY: Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.

TIA: That's horrible!

JERRY: What's that perfume you're wearing?

TIA: oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today.

JERRY: What is that smell?

TIA: It's here somewhere.

JERRY: It smells like the beach.

TIA: Exactly.

JERRY: Oh my God is that the new perfume?

TIA: Yeah.

JERRY: I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.

TIA: Are you sure?

JERRY: And you're the model for this perfume?

(Noise)

JERRY: Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]

KRAMER: Hey

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]

JERRY: Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.

KRAMER: I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.

JERRY: All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.

KRAMER: Hello.

(Jerry pushes Tia back away from Kramer)

KRAMER: How tall are you?

TIA: Five ten.

KRAMER: Come on lets see - Back to Back.

JERRY: NO! Kramer!

KRAMER: What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.

JERRY: Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.

KRAMER: What's that?

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: That smell. What's that smell?

JERRY: (starting the Dust Buster) What smell?

KRAMER: It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.

JERRY: Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..

KRAMER: Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?

JERRY: Okay.

KRAMER: Yeah. Nice meeting you.

TIA: Nice meeting you too.

JERRY: I'll see you later.

(Kramer slowly leaves as Jerry shuts door on him)

JERRY: Ooow, that was close.

KRAMER: [OC] THE BEACH!!!

(enters)

KRAMER: You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.

TIA: It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.

KRAMER: CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.

JERRY: I know look at this [shows ad]

KRAMER: Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.

(End of scene)


[Therapist's Office]

(George enters)

DANA: Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.

GEORGE: Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?

DANA: So uh, she broke up with you? ...

GEORGE: Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?

DANA: It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?

GEORGE: What is with this damn zipper?

DANA: It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.

GEORGE: It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.

DANA: It doesn't matter, so ...

GEORGE: This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...

DANA: George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?

GEORGE: ... Susan.

DANA: Okay, we're getting somewhere.

GEORGE: UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.


[Jerry's Apartment]

ELAINE: Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.

JERRY: Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.

ELAINE: It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.

JERRY: I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?

ELAINE: Well, you know. It's a picture?

JERRY: Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.

ELAINE: Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?

JERRY: ... um ...

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Did you look at look at this picture carefully?

ELAINE: Carefully?

JERRY: Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Here. Take a look. What, what is that?

ELAINE: (gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.

JERRY: That's what I thought.

ELAINE: That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.

JERRY: DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?

ELAINE: Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey!

ELAINE: Have you seen the card?

KRAMER: What card?

ELAINE: This car.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.

ELAINE: Well did you notice anything unusual about it?

KRAMER: No.

ELAINE: Well come here and take a look.

KRAMER: Yeah, so?

ELAINE: So, what's that?

KRAMER: That's a nipple.

ELAINE: Right!!

KRAMER: Ooo!

ELAINE: Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?

KRAMER: Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,

ELAINE: It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.

JERRY: Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.

ELAINE: No. I don't want him looking.

JERRY: Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.

ELAINE: Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.


[Jerry enters with Newman]

NEWMAN: Okay. What is it?

JERRY: Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.

NEWMAN: Your nipple's showing.

JERRY: Okay. Thanks.

NEWMAN: Anything else?

JERRY: No.

NEWMAN: All right. See you later.

JERRY: What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.

KRAMER: I got them too.

JERRY: Everybody's got them.


[Therapist's Office]

DANA: You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...

GEORGE: Pull it up a little bit.

DANA: Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.

GEORGE: Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.

DANA: No. Let me try...

GEORGE: Take it right off the chest...

DANA: Ugh, ..

GEORGE: You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.

DANA: YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.

GEORGE: Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?

DANA: Yeah.

GEORGE: (stares at card)


[Jerry's car - BMW]

[Jerry scratching right side of nose. Tia in a cab sees him, in shock. Cab pulls away.]

JERRY: No, No, No, No, Oh, No.


[Jerry's Apartment]

(Jerry hanging up phone)

JERRY: Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.

GEORGE: Was it a scratch or a pick?

JERRY: It was a scratch.

GEORGE: Hey. It's me.

JERRY: Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?

(Buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: (OC) It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

GEORGE: Was there any nostril penetration?

JERRY: There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.

GEORGE: So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?

JERRY: Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?

GEORGE: I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.

JERRY: Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?

GEORGE: No. That's disgusting!

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!

GEORGE: Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.

ELAINE: You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Got any Double Crunch?

JERRY: yeah. I think I do.

KRAMER: What's that perfume?

ELAINE: What, Ocean.

KRAMER: That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.

JERRY: I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.

KRAMER: I thought you said it was a scratch.

JERRY: But that's not what she thinks.

GEORGE: Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.

JERRY: All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.

KRAMER: Let's go.


[Monk's]

GEORGE: It'll be different this time.

SUSAN: I need someone a little more stable.

GEORGE: I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!

SUSAN: People don't change.

GEORGE: I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.

SUSAN: I'm not a soft boiled egg.

GEORGE: And I am not a piece of toast.

SUSAN: I just don't think we have anything in common.

GEORGE: That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.

SUSAN: Why were there so many cockroaches?

GEORGE: Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]

SUSAN: And they got along?

GEORGE: Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!


[Trump Towers]

KRAMER: I want to talk to Calvin.

SECRETARY: You can't go in there.

KRAMER: Let me talk to Calvin.

[Kramer enters office]

TIA: Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah, uh.

CALVIN KLEIN: Who are you?

KRAMER: I'm here to talk about the ocean.

CALVIN KLEIN: Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves]

KRAMER: Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.

CALVIN KLEIN: Neither do I.


[Outside office]

JERRY: Hello there you are.

TIA: What are you doing here?

JERRY: Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA: Well, I've been busy.

JERRY: Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)

TIA: (Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this..

JERRY: But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA: I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators)

JERRY: But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!

TIA: I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry)

JERRY: No! No pick!

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Calvin Klein's office]

(Kramer, standing, is talking with Klein)

KRAMER: All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..

KLEIN: (Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face..

KRAMER: Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.

KLEIN: You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.

KRAMER: Well, yeah.

KLEIN: Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular..

KRAMER: You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.

KLEIN: You're spectacular.

KRAMER: (Flattered) Oh?

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Elaine's office]

(Elaine's fighting with her boyfriend, Fred, about her Christmas card)

ELAINE: I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED: (Incredulous) Soo - what happened?!

ELAINE: Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.

FRED: I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.

ELAINE: Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST: Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE: Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER: (Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE: Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Susan's apartment building]

(George and Susan are slowly making their way up the stars to Susan's apartment. He's treating it very much like the long walk to an execution; she's mellow and happy)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Calvin Klein's office]

(A couple people are sitting with Klein, and talking. Kramer is no where in sight)

WOMAN: About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

KLEIN: His buttocks are sublime!

MAN: Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.

WOMAN: (Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

(Kramer casually puts his hand on the wall, attempting to lean on it, but the corner is rounded, and he slides along it, eventually falling down. Fortunately, the other people don't notice - they're talking amongst themselves)

MAN: You've done it again, C.K.!

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Calvin Klein office building]

(In a hallway, Tia and others are waiting for the elevator. Jerry, deciding to make a speach, starts to preach to the crowd)

JERRY: An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Elaine's office]

(Elaine's standing in the doorway, yelling at Fred)

ELAINE: I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

(Scene ends)


[Monk's]

GX: So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.

JERRY: The pick?

ELAINE: The pick?

GEORGE: She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.

JERRY: I think I've seen that look.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.

JERRY: Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.

GEORGE: Your buttocks are spectacular.

ELAINE: Oh my!

KRAMER: What?

ELAINE: I'm not sure but... I think I see your...

What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? Didja ever notice, they never hire anyone between the ages of fifteen... and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you the ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips the ticket, he's a hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle. You're fifteen, you sell the tickets. Then you leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater three feet away. Ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move three feet.

% A night at the Improv. Jerry receives some disturbing news from the manager: The show has been delayed.

JERRY: You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it!

% As impeccable and precise in his business dealings as he is with his apartment.

KERNIS: I hear you, guy.

JERRY: And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!

% In the background is the plot complication of the week: Buckles. The manager assures Jerry that Buckles isn't on the menu. He just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out.

KERNIS: Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?

JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30.

% On consideration, Jerry decides to take the 11 o'clock spot and skip the movie. Jerry is on his way out the door when Buckles spots him.

BUCKLES: Hey, Jer!

JERRY: [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]

% At the Paragon Theater, George joins the end of a queue. He taps the shoulder of the man in front of him.

GEORGE: Excuse me, do you have a ticket?

MAN: No.

GEORGE: Okay. Good.

% Misunderstanding number one: When Jerry shows up at the other comedy place, the manager tells him his spot was for 9:15, not 9:50. The manager had no choice but to give Jerry's spot to...

BUCKLES: Jerry!

JERRY: What are <you> doing here?

BUCKLES: Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''

% And you're no Jack Kennedy. Jerry is understandably unimpressed. He tries to escape, but Buckles won't let him. Jerry is on his way to the theater to tell his friends he can't make it, then back to the Improv. Buckles offers to join him and split the fare. ``I've got time! It'll give us a chance to know each other a little better!'' Elaine joins George in the queue.

ELAINE: I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.

GEORGE: Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.

ELAINE: ``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!

GEORGE: ``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!

ELAINE: Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!

GEORGE: Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.

% Apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. Misunderstanding number two: Kramer joins George and Elaine after looking for them at the Paradise Twin around the corner. Elaine hates the Paradise because it's a multiplex; she'd rather see a movie on a big screen. Something catches Kramer's eye.

KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.

GEORGE & ELAINE: No, wait!

GEORGE: You're not going to get back here in time!

KRAMER: I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!

ELAINE: You can get a hot dog in the theater.

KRAMER: I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!

ELAINE: Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.

KRAMER: Well, just save me a seat.

% This touches a raw nerve.

ELAINE: No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!

% Kramer just asks for his ticket, but George doesn't have them.

GEORGE: I'm in line to buy.

ELAINE: No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.

GEORGE: No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.

ELAINE: Then how come we're not moving?

KRAMER: Good question.

% George addresses the man in front of him.

GEORGE: Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?

% George gloats, knowing what the answer is going to be.

MAN: Holders.

% Instant double-take.

GEORGE: But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!

MAN: I didn't. My friend was getting it.

GEORGE: [furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.

% Misunderstanding number three. George goes to get tickets, leaving Elaine and Kramer to talk behind his back.

ELAINE: Can you believe him?

KRAMER: He's spaced out.

% Let him who is without sin, Kramer.

ELAINE: How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?

KRAMER: [thinks for a while]

ELAINE: [gives up] Yeah, exactly...

% The movie has sold out. ``Real good, George. Real good.'' It's now 10:20, and Kramer suggests they go watch the 10:45 showing of "CheckMate" at the Paradise. Elaine enters whine mode.

ELAINE: I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!

GEORGE: It's the same movie! What's the difference?

ELAINE: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.

% But she gives in. New plan. George and Elaine will get tickets at the Paradise, while Kramer waits at the Paragon to tell Jerry of the change in plans. But Kramer can't keep his eye off the Papaya King sign, flashing, beckoning, practically begging... Jerry suffers through Buckles' telling of his life story in the taxi.

JERRY: [to taxi driver] Take the Park!

BUCKLES: No no no, take 55th.

% Jerry can't stand it. Buckles somehow drifted onto the subject of fish and how much he hates it.

BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!

JERRY: [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!

BUCKLES: I had a point?

% At the Paradise, George succeeds in obtaining the tickets, and he joins Elaine in the ticket-holders line. (Right?)

GEORGE: Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.

ELAINE: Sigh/Ugh.

GEORGE: I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.

ELAINE: Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.

GEORGE: So what's your point?

% Yeah, what's your point?

GEORGE: By the way, you owe me seven fifty.

ELAINE: Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?

GEORGE: No, I don't have any change.

ELAINE: Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.

GEORGE: Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.

ELAINE: Yeah, you *could*...

GEORGE: Might be easier.

ELAINE: I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.

GEORGE: [trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: So... Can I have it?

ELAINE: I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.

GEORGE: Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?

ELAINE: I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.

GEORGE: I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.

ELAINE: [exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.

% The line begins to move. George offers to wait outside for K+J.

GEORGE: You go in and save seats.

ELAINE: [in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!

% With extreme reluctance, Elaine goes on ahead to save seats.

% The taxi is stuck in traffic. Jerry bawls out Buckles for choosing 55th on a Saturday night. Buckles considers how various famous people would react to be stuck in traffic, using Jerry as an unwilling guinea pig for his material.

BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.

JERRY: That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.

BUCKLES: Jerry! Don't start up with me!

JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab...

BUCKLES: But Jerry, quit riffing!

JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?

BUCKLES: [pause] Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?

% Apparently, not.

[Elaine does her best to save three seats.]

ELAINE: No, these are saved.

MAN: All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.

ELAINE: What, is that a rule?

% George comes in; J+K haven't appeared. Elaine sends George to the Paragon to give Kramer his and Jerry's tickets. Throughout the conversation, Elaine fends off would-be claim-jumpers.

GEORGE: Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.

ELAINE: [stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.

% George returns to one of his favorite topics.

GEORGE: Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.

ELAINE: Can we do this later, George?

GEORGE: Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.

% Kramer stands, mesmerized by the sign that reads, ``100% pure fresh beef. Tastier than Filet Mignon.'' He rushes to the ticket booth.

KRAMER: Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?

% Elaine is accosted from all sides.

ELAINE: No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!

WOMAN: Which one?

ELAINE: These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!

% She can't take it any longer.

ELAINE: Oh, take 'em.

% George reaches the ticket booth of the Paragon.

GEORGE: Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?

CLERK: ... flared nostrils?

GEORGE: Yeah.

CLERK: Nope, haven't seen him.

% George leaves, unsuccessful.

[Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.]

BUCKLES: Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, *please*, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?

JERRY: Your trench coat in my closet?

% It's not like he's asking for a ride to the airport or anything.

BUCKLES: Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.

% Jerry sanely declines. Jerry doesn't see any of his friends, so he figures they're inside. He'll go in to tell them he can't join them.

BUCKLES: We should see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. I hear it's really hot.

JERRY: No thanks, maybe some other time.

BUCKLES: Really? Do you really mean that?

JERRY: No, I don't.

% Brutal honesty once again saves the day.

BUCKLES: You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?

JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.

% Jerry pays his half of the fare then approaches the entrance to the Paragon.

JERRY: Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?

USHER: [indicates ``okay'']

% Just after Jerry goes inside, Kramer clomps to the ticket booth at warp speed, clutching a precious Papaya King hot dog in his hand.

KRAMER: Hey, did that guy show up?

CLERK: The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...

KRAMER: No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.

CLERK: Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.

% Behind Elaine, a women chats loudly with her friend.

WOMAN: So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?

WOMAN: And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.

ELAINE: [annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.

WOMAN: What's the problem?

ELAINE: [momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.

WOMAN: It's the ``Coming Attractions''.

% Elaine collects her things and leaves.

WOMAN: So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...

% At the entrance to the Paradise Twin, George is stopped by the usher.

USHER: Ticket, sir?

GEORGE: Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?

USHER: Do you have your stub?

GEORGE: [as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?

USHER: Mm hm.

% George sifts through his pockets, going on about how he never needed a stub before.

GEORGE: You don't remember me?

USHER: It's a big city, sir.

GEORGE: I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?

% Unable to find his stub, George gives him Kramer's ticket. The ticket-taker tears the ticket and gives George the stub. George goes into the ``CheckMate'' theater just as Elaine leaves it through the other door. Like two dips, passing in the night.

GEORGE: [whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!

% Various movie patrons tell George to shut up.

GEORGE: [quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!

% He is quickly shouted down, making his escape through the exit. The exit to the street.

[In the theater at the Paragon, Jerry whispers ``Elaine'' and, hearing no response, gives up.]

NARRATOR: The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

% Something about this preview attracts Jerry's attention. Not sure exactly what, though...

NARRATOR: It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman. ``Rochelle Rochelle'', now playing at Paradise 2.

%Meanwhile, Kramer gives up waiting outside the Paragon. Seconds thereafter, Jerry rushes out of the theater and hails a cab. Or tries to.

[Elaine reaches the concessions stand and has to deal with the perky clerk.]

ELAINE: Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?

CLERK: Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?

ELAINE: What's the difference?

CLERK: Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.

ELAINE: [momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?

CLERK: There is no small. Small is Medium.

ELAINE: What's... medium?

CLERK: Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.

ELAINE: Oh-kay. Gimme the large.

CLERK: That's medium.

ELAINE: Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?

CLERK: There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.

ELAINE: What's `medium'?

CLERK: Adult.

ELAINE: Do adults ever order the child-size?

CLERK: [chuckling] Not usually.

ELAINE: [laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.

CLERK: Do you want butter?

ELAINE: Is it *real* butter?

CLERK: [perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!

ELAINE: [exasperated] What is it made of?

CLERK: [perkily] It's yellow!

% Leaving the inanities of modern marketing aside, we switch to Jerry, still outside trying to hail a cab. He finally gets one. The driver speaks with a Russian accent.

JERRY: 44th and 9th.

DRIVER: Have you got a cigarette?

JERRY: No.

% George once again tries to get past the ticket-taker.

USHER: Ticket, sir?

GEORGE: We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!

USHER: I need to see your stub.

GEORGE: [realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.

% George empties his pockets in a quest for a ticket stub. No dice.

GEORGE: There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.

% George goes past the concessions stand, not seeing Elaine, who is searching her pocketbook for change to pay for her popcorn and drink.

USHER: Ticket, sir?

KRAMER: Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.

USHER: Go ahead.

% George dwells at the ``Rochelle Rochelle'' sign for what must be the 5th time this episode. Kramer heads straight into the theater.

KRAMER: Is that seat taken?

Woman Behind ELAINE: It's all yours.

% Kramer lankily stumbles into the seat, but finds the fit uncomfortable.

Driver: I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.

JERRY: Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?

DRIVER: [taken aback] No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'!

% Jerry nervously glances at his watch.

(Elaine returns to the theater, arms laden with popcorn and soda, trying to find her seat. Various patrons tell her to sit down already. She is finally shouted down and pushed out of the aisle, causing her to spill most of her popcorn in the process. George sits in a half-empty theater watching ``Rochelle Rochelle''. Not a female audience member in sight.)

MAN: You're soaking wet. Who are you?

ROCHELLE: My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan. I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk.

MAN: Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.

ROCHELLE: Oh, my hand's so cold, I can barely get these buttons open.

% George is clearly waiting to see Rochelle's other buttons.

ROCHELLE: Oh, that's much better. Much...

(A tall man sits down in front of George, blocking his view of Rochelle's Christmas cards. Elaine stumbles to the ticket-taker, trying to shake popcorn out of her hair.)

ELAINE: I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!

USHER: There's a seat in the front row.

ELAINE: No no, I can't sit in the front row.

USHER: Well, you're going to have to wait, then.

ELAINE: I can't stand around here for *two hours*!

USHER: I could let you see ``Rochelle Rochelle''.

ELAINE: [heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.

% Elaine plods off, then realizes she had something else to say.

ELAINE: Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?

USHER: Haven't seen him.

% Meanwhile, at a service station, the taxi driver assures Jerry that they will be leaving very soon. He'll just go across the street to buy a cigarette.

% From his pocket, Kramer digs into his treasured Papaya King hot dog. Then discovers the source of his discomfort: He's sitting on a coat.

JERRY: Hey, did I make it?

KERNIS: Sorry.

JERRY: Oh, great. That's great. What a night.

% Off-screen, we hear appreciative applause.

ANNOUNCER: Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen. Another round of applause for Pat Buckles!

% Jerry spots Buckles.

JERRY: You got my spot?

BUCKLES: That athlete's foot bit killed!

JERRY: Really...

BUCKLES: Do you think I need to lose some weight?

JERRY: Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.

JERRY: My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...

BUCKLES: Come on, we can still catch most of ``Rochelle Rochelle''.

JERRY: ``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?

BUCKLES: A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

JERRY: [his interest piqued] Minsk?

% George and Elaine watch ``Rochelle Rochelle'' in different parts of the theater. Also there are Jerry and Buckles. George and Buckles seem to be enjoying the movie; Jerry and Elaine can't deal with it.

ELAINE: Oh, gimme a break!

% George turns, as does Jerry.

JERRY: Elaine?

% Elaine's face lights up.

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: Elaine!

VOICE: [whispered] Shut up.

GEORGE: Jerry?

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Elaine?

ELAINE: George! [waves hi]

% Another prized Seinfeld moment, soon to be copycatted around the country.

JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?

VOICE: [whispered] Will you shut up?

ELAINE: I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!

JERRY: Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.

BUCKLES: You're leaving?

JERRY: Yeah.

% The music from the movie continues over the next, heart-rending scene...

BUCKLES: [holding out his coat] Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month.

JERRY: I don't want the coat.

BUCKLES: Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!

% Jerry, Elaine, and George fill each other in on their respective miseries out in the lobby.

GEORGE: [studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.

JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!

GEORGE: I still paid for it!

% Kramer wanders out of ``CheckMate'', his newly-found coat draped casually over his shoulders. Jerry looks through his wallet.

JERRY: I only have a twenty.

ELAINE: That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?

KRAMER: It was on the seat...

ELAINE: *YOU* took my seat!?

GEORGE: You uh owe me for the ticket.

KRAMER: Yeah, right...

ELAINE: What is that stain [on my coat]?

KRAMER: It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?


[Closing Monologue]

I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going: ``Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh...'' Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] ``Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''

What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer is the only person that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of the fun things for them is to say, "objection." "Objection! Objection, your Honor." Objection, of course, is the adult version of, "Fraid not." To which the judge can say two things, he can say, "overruled" which is the adult version of "Fraid so," or he could say, "sustained," which is the adult version of "Duh."


[George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental woman.]

GEORGE: So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?

CHERYL: Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.

GEORGE: What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?

CHERYL (laughing) Are your friends as funny as you?

GEORGE: No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.

(Quick pan to the front door as Jerry and Elaine are entering.)

ELAINE: Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you

JERRY: Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.

ELAINE: It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.

JERRY: Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.

(Cut back to George and Cheryl at the counter.)

CHERYL: Here's my card.

GEORGE: Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.

CHERYL: Nice meeting you.

GEORGE: Yeah.

(Cheryl leaves, George walks over to the booth to meet Jerry and Elaine.)

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hey, how ya doin?

GEORGE: You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.

ELAINE: What, the one who just left?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.

ELAINE: Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.

JERRY: (looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!

BABU: Jerry!

JERRY: Look at you, you got the job.

BABU: Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you.

JERRY: Oh, I didn't do anything.

BABU: Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in your building.

JERRY: Come on.

BABU: You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and I can never thank you enough for everything you do.

(Cut back to George and Elaine.)

GEORGE: You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.

ELAINE: No they don't.

GEORGE: Ooooh, yes they do.

ELAINE: Nooo.

GEORGE: Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.

(Elaine nods her head in approval.)

GEORGE: You mean that's true, I'm right?!

JERRY: Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.

BABU: Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful.

JERRY: Ok, I'll see you around the building.

BABU: I'll see you *in* the building.

JERRY: (returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?

GEORGE: Who's he?

JERRY: Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.

JERRY: Can you bring my mail then?

GEORGE: What mail?

ELAINE: I picked up his mail while he was on the road

GEORGE: Why didn't Kramer pick it up?

JERRY: Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?

JERRY: Monday, I think.

GEORGE: Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.

JERRY: Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.

(George has a dream sequence where the four of them are at a dinner table and Cheryl is laughing hysterically at one of Jerry's jokes.)

JERRY: ...he never heard of corduroy!

CHERYL: (howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!

JERRY: He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.

(Dream sequence ends.)

GEORGE: No, no I don't think so.

ELAINE: Why?

GEORGE: Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.

JERRY: I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.

GEORGE: She might not be comfortable.

ELAINE: Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.

JERRY: We'll be funny.

GEORGE: No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.

ELAINE: Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.

JERRY: No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.

ELAINE: Why?

JERRY: No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.


[George and Cheryl are at Isabella's.]

GEORGE: (tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.

(Cheryl laughs.)

GEORGE: Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.

(Just then the headwaiter seats Jerry and Elaine at the next table.)

JERRY: Look who's here! Georgie-boy!

GEORGE: What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?

ELAINE: No, I talked him into it.

GEORGE: What happened to the auto show?

JERRY: Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.

ELAINE: The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.

(Jerry and Cheryl laugh, George, unamused, tries pushing Jerry and Elaine away from their table.)

ELAINE (to Cheryl, who's rising to shake her outstretched hand) Hi.

GEORGE: Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.

JERRY (shaking hands in turn) Hi, nice to meet you.

CHERYL: Would you like to join us?

GEORGE: Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.

CHERYL: Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.

ELAINE: Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?

GEORGE: (as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.

ELAINE: Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--

GEORGE: No! No.

ELAINE: No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?

GEORGE: (interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...

ELAINE: Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.

CHERYL: Oh? What happened?

ELAINE: Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.

CHERYL: Was he Chinese?

ELAINE: Yeah.

CHERYL: Is your last name Benes?

JERRY: How did you know?

CHERYL: Ping is my cousin!

ELAINE: No!

JERRY: That's so funny!

CHERYL: I'm handling his case!

ELAINE: What? You're Cheryl Fong?

CHERYL: That's right!

(By now, they're all laughing.)

ELAINE: Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!

CHERYL: Yeah, I know!

ELAINE: Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?

CHERYL: Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.

ELAINE: Tell Ping I said hello.

JERRY: Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.

(They all laugh as Cheryl walks away.)

GEORGE (suddenly not laughing) What are you doing? What are you doing?

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: This is not good. This is not good.

JERRY: What's the matter?

GEORGE: I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.

JERRY: Why not?

ELAINE: He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.

JERRY: Biff?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: You're not worried about that?

GEORGE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?

ELAINE: He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.

JERRY: Well, should we leave?

GEORGE: Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

ELAINE: This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?

JERRY: I don't have to be funny, I don't care.

GEORGE: You don't?

JERRY: No way! It's completely under my control.

ELAINE: No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.

JERRY: Of course I can, am I being funny now?

ELAINE: A little.

JERRY: Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: George, is this funny?

GEORGE: It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.

ELAINE: What? What did I do?

(Cheryl returns.)

GEORGE: Hi.

JERRY: (subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.

CHERYL: Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.

ELAINE: Well, nobody likes to get old, right?

JERRY: Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.

GEORGE: Funny guy, huh?


[Elaine is bringing Jerry's mail to his apartment.]

ELAINE: Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.

JERRY: Well thank you very much, it's about time.

ELAINE: Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.

JERRY: Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.

ELAINE: Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.

JERRY: (leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.

(They hear a noise from the hallway.)

JERRY: Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.

KRAMER: Well, the camp ended a few days early.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Uh, well there was an incident.

JERRY: What happened?

KRAMER: I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.

ELAINE: You punched who in the mouth?

KRAMER: Mickey Mantle.

JERRY: What happened?

KRAMER: Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.

JERRY: Wow! Joe Pepitone!

KRAMER: Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.

JERRY: You plunked him.

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.

JERRY: Wow, this is incredible!

(A voice is heard from the hallway.)

BABU: Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!

JERRY: What's going on out there?

BABU: What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad.

JERRY: Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.

ELAINE: (to Kramer) Yeah, so?

KRAMER: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"

ELAINE: So what'd you do?

KRAMER: Well, I got the hell out of there.

JERRY (running back in) They took Babu away!

ELAINE: They took Babu away?!

JERRY: Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.

BABU (calling from the street) Jerry! Jerry! Help me!

JERRY: I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!

KRAMER: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.

JERRY: (thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Well this is interesting.

ELAINE: What is it?

JERRY: It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.

KRAMER: Well, doesn't he need that?


[Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.

ELAINE: Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.

JERRY: Yeah, so am I being funny now?

ELAINE: No, actually, you're not being funny now.

JERRY: See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.

GEORGE: No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.

JERRY: Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.

GEORGE: What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.

JERRY: Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.

GEORGE: Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.

JERRY: Ah, will you stop it already?

GEORGE: Jerry, please?

JERRY: How long is this gonna go on?

GEORGE: Till I'm comfortable.

JERRY: Well, when is that gonna be?

GEORGE: After consummation.

JERRY: Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.


[Jerry and Cheryl are at the coffee shop.]

CHERYL: I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.

JERRY: (somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.

CHERYL: You're a very serious person, aren't you?

JERRY: Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.

CHERYL: I understand.

(Jerry reaches for the milk for his coffee.)

CHERYL: I think it's curdled.

JERRY: I don't care.

CHERYL: Do you ever laugh?

JERRY: Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.

CHERYL: That's so sad. What do you do?

JERRY: I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.

ELAINE: (entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?

JERRY: Yeah, I'll just pay for this.

ELAINE: Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.

CHERYL: Hi.

ELAINE: Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.

CHERYL: Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.

ELAINE (laughing) You're kidding.

CHERYL (laughing) No, I'm not.


[Jerry and Elaine are at the Immigration office.]

JERRY: Babu!

BABU: Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!

JERRY: You remember Elaine.

BABU: Yes, yes of course!

ELAINE: Nice to meet you.

BABU: So nice of you both to come.

JERRY: Oh, Babu.

BABU: No no, you're both very kind, very kind.

JERRY& ELAINE (in unison) Oh, well, you know.

ELAINE: We try.

JERRY: We do what we can.

ELAINE: We do what we can.

BABU: The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it.

JERRY: Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.

BABU: Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.

JERRY: Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.

BABU: Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine.

JERRY: Oh, I don't want to bother you.

BABU: No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man.

JERRY: So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.

BABU: Come again?

JERRY: You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.

ELAINE: Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.

BABU: You had my Visa application?!

JERRY: Well not technically.

BABU: (extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!!

JERRY: Well what about her?

BABU: I kill both of you!!

JERRY: Babu?!

BABU: No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!

JERRY: Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!

BABU: The wheels are in motion?

JERRY: The wheels are in motion, things are happening!


[George and Cheryl are parked.]

GEORGE: Jerry?

CHERYL: I'm very attracted to him.

GEORGE: You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.

CHERYL: He never said anything funny.

GEORGE: He can't not be funny.

CHERYL: No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.

GEORGE: Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.

CHERYL: So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?

GEORGE: Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.

CHERYL: I gotta go.

GEORGE: Well, should I call you later?

CHERYL: Please don't.

GEORGE: But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!


[Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?

JERRY: I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it, he should be back by now. (Answering the buzzer) Yeah?

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: C'mon up.

(They hear a voice in the hallway, Jerry opens the door.)

JERRY: Babu must be back.

BABU'S BROTHER: Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?

JERRY: Where's Babu?

BABU'S BROTHER: He is in Pakistan!

JERRY: Who are you?

BABU'S BROTHER: I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed.

JERRY: I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.

BABU'S BROTHER: Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!

ELAINE: (offering a drink) Snapple?

BABU'S BROTHER: No, too fruity.

(Babu's Brother leaves, George enters.)

JERRY: Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.

GEORGE: She didn't help him?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Where is he?

JERRY: He's in Pakistan.

GEORGE: Oh boy.

JERRY: What do you mean, oh boy?

GEORGE: Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.

JERRY: Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.

GEORGE: What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.

JERRY: That's because she had my mail.

(Kramer enters.)

ELAINE: Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.

KRAMER: Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.

JERRY: How could you go in there?

KRAMER: Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!

JERRY: Well, what happened?

KRAMER: I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"

ELAINE: So, what did he do?

KRAMER: Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.

(There's a knock on Kramer's door.)

VOICE: Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah? It's my Chinese food.

(Ping enters with a bag of food.)

ELAINE: Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.

PING: Not anymore.

ELAINE: What?

PING: Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.

ELAINE: Why?

PING: She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.

(Ping exits.)


[Babu and a friend are sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe in Pakistan]

BABU: So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here.

BABU'S FRIEND: This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?

BABU: I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.


[Closing monologue]

I am for open immigration but that sign we have on the front of the Statue of Liberty, 'Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...', can't we just say, 'Hey, the door's open, we'll take whoever you got.'? Do we have to specify the wretched refuse? I mean, why don't we just say, 'Give us the unhappy, the sad, the slow, the ugly, people that can't drive, that they have trouble merging, if they can't stay in their lane, if they don't signal, they can't parallel park, if they're sneezing, if they're stuffed up, if they're clogged, if they have bad penmanship, don't return calls, if they have dandruff, food between their teeth, if they have bad credit, if they have no credit, missed a spot shaving, in other words any dysfunctional defective slob that you can somehow cattle prod onto a wagon, send them over, we want 'em.'

The basic problem with the beginning of the relationship, I think, is that each person has their own sexual time-table of what should happen when, that the other person knows nothing about. That's why I really think we need some sort of sexual rulebook, where it's written down and agreed upon - sexual, standard, dating procedure. Know what I mean? So if there's any problems, you can go, (takes a small booklet out of his inside pocket) "Look, honey, I'm very sorry, but we've been out three times, and according to Article 7, Section 5, there's got to be some physical contact, as you can see." (Gestures to the booklet.) "Otherwise, I will report you to the board, and they can put out a warrant for an embrace."



[Jerry's Apartment]

(Jerry and George, working on the script for the "Jerry" pilot episode.)

GEORGE (writing on a notepad): Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"

JERRY (copying it down and grinning): That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.

GEORGE (laughing): I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!

JERRY: Yeah, it's funny!

GEORGE: I mean, how funny is this?

JERRY (low voice): It's funny.

GEORGE: I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!

JERRY: It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.

GEORGE: Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.

JERRY: Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.

GEORGE: Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.

JERRY: Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.

GEORGE: Right

JERRY: (Thinks) What does she say...?

GEORGE (thinking): I don't know, what do women say?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.

JERRY: You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.

GEORGE: Alright, forget Elaine.

JERRY: Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER (to Jerry): You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.

JERRY: Who?

KRAMER: Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.

JERRY: Did you talk to her?

KRAMER: Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?

JERRY: So what happened?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.

JERRY: Yeah, I know about the three dates.

KRAMER: You know what I did? I snubbed her.

JERRY: What do you mean, you snubbed her?

KRAMER: I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.

JERRY (smiling): Right by her?

KRAMER: Right by her!

JERRY (to George, hugs Kramer happily): What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.

KRAMER: Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.



[Monk's]

(Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is showing her the script.)

ELAINE (throws the script at Jerry): I'm not even in here!

JERRY: Yeah, I know.

ELAINE: Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.

JERRY: Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...

ELAINE: You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?

JERRY: Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.

ELAINE: You have no idea?

JERRY: Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)

GAIL (to Jerry): I thought I'd find you here.

JERRY: Well, Gail Cunningham.

ELAINE: Hi, Gail.

GAIL: Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?

JERRY: Why?

GAIL: He snubbed me.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GAIL: Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?

JERRY: Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)

ELAINE: I thought you were finished.

JERRY: I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?

GAIL: So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?

JERRY: I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.

GAIL: Well, tell him that I am mad at him.

JERRY: Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?

GAIL: Pfeiffer's.

JERRY: Ah, the power lunch crowd.

GAIL (to Elaine): Nice shoes!

ELAINE: Oh. Thank you.

GAIL: Where'd you get 'em?

ELAINE (modest): They're um, Botticelli's.

GAIL (impressed): Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.

ELAINE: Really.

JERRY: Would you care to join us?

GAIL: No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)

JERRY: See ya.

ELAINE (irritated, imitates Gail): "Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."

JERRY: That bothered you?

ELAINE: Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.

JERRY: It did?

ELAINE: Yes! Couldn't you see that?

JERRY (thinks): No. This is why you're not in the pilot.



[George in a session with Dana, his therapist.]

DANA: Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.

GEORGE: Yeah, I feel like I've grown.

DANA: Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.

GEORGE: Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?

DANA: Yes, yes I did.

GEORGE (beaming): Well, what'd you think?

DANA (unenthusiastic): Uh...it was...good.

GEORGE: You didn't like it?

DANA: Well, no, I -

GEORGE: I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?

DANA: It wasn't funny.

GEORGE: It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?

DANA: No, I didn't find it funny.

GEORGE: You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?

DANA: Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.

GEORGE: Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.

DANA: George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.

GEORGE: How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.

DANA: I think you'd better go.

GEORGE: Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!



[Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both standing by the door. Elaine enters.]

GEORGE (immediately, to Elaine): So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?

ELAINE: I guess she didn't think it was funny.

GEORGE: Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!

JERRY: I thought your mother's paying for it.

GEORGE: And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."

JERRY (to Elaine): You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.

ELAINE: What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)

KRAMER (to Jerry): Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)

JERRY (catches Elaine): Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.

ELAINE: Well, you know, I...

KRAMER: I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)

JERRY: You what?

KRAMER: Yeah, I kissed her.

JERRY: You kissed her?

KRAMER: Right on the mouth.

JERRY: What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?

KRAMER: Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)

JERRY: And what did she do?

KRAMER: She kissed me back.

JERRY: I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?

KRAMER (realizing): Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!

GEORGE: No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)

KRAMER (to Elaine): Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.

ELAINE: What? Who told you that?

KRAMER: Gail Cunningham.

ELAINE: I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?

KRAMER: Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.

ELAINE (angrily): "How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)

JERRY: So what?

ELAINE: So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)



[Gail cooking in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's Restaurant. Elaine marches in.]

ELAINE: Hey! Gail!

GAIL: Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...!

ELAINE: Why are you talking about my shoes?

GAIL: What?

ELAINE: My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.

GAIL: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)

WAITER: Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?

GAIL: Look Elaine, I am very busy here.

ELAINE: Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!

GAIL: I am not discussing this. This is insane.

WAITER: You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!

GAIL: Ya ya ya, here.

(Gail passes the plate to the waiter in front of Elaine. Elaine sneezes on it. The waiter brings the pasta to the dining room and serves it to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC.)

WAITER: Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.

RUSSELL: Thank you.

WAITER: Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.



[Jerry and George arrive at Dalrymple's apartment to discuss the script.]

RUSSELL (opening the door): Well, come in. (They shake hands.)

JERRY & GEORGE: Hi.

RUSSELL: Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.

JERRY: Are you alright?

RUSSELL: Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.

JERRY: Oh, Where did you eat?

RUSSELL: Pfeiffer's.

JERRY: Ah. I know the chef there.

RUSSELL: Yeah. The food's usually terrific.

GEORGE: My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)

RUSSELL: What are you saying?

GEORGE: Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.

RUSSELL: Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.

JERRY: Oh, you have a daughter?

RUSSELL: Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.

GEORGE: Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)

RUSSELL: Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)

JERRY: What?

RUSSELL: Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)

JERRY: I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?

GEORGE: Pasta primavera.

JERRY: Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: Yeah.

RUSSELL (coming out of the bathroom): Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.

GEORGE: So, you were saying how, um...about the script...

RUSSELL: Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)

GEORGE: More jokes?

JERRY: Another ending?

GEORGE: A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)

JERRY: Maybe we should go.

GEORGE: We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)

RUSSELL (from bathroom): Oh God. Oh my god.

JERRY: I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)

MOLLY: Hello.

JERRY: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi.

MOLLY: I'm Molly.

JERRY: Oh, I'm Jerry.

GEORGE: George.

JERRY: We're here discussing our script with your father.

GEORGE: He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)

MOLLY: Daddy? Are you okay?

RUSSELL (from bathroom): Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)

GEORGE: So, you live with your mother, huh?

MOLLY: Uh, yeah.

GEORGE (to Jerry): Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.

JERRY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)

MOLLY: Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?

RUSSELL: It's just a stomach thing.

MOLLY: Yuck.

RUSSELL (to Jerry and George): We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)

GEORGE: You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)

RUSSELL (angrily): Get a good look, Costanza?



[Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: What were you doing?

GEORGE: Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!

JERRY: You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.

GEORGE: It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.

JERRY: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.

GEORGE: All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.

JERRY: That's why I poked.

GEORGE: That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)

GAIL: Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?

JERRY: What?

GAIL: She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.

JERRY: She did?

KRAMER: Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.

GAIL: So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)

GEORGE: Pasta primavera?

JERRY: Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)

KRAMER (to Jerry): She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.

JERRY: She is?

KRAMER: She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)

JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Stu.

GEORGE (lazily swinging the garbage bag around): From NBC?

JERRY: (to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)



[Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY (to Elaine): If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.

ELAINE: Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!

GEORGE: He poked me!

JERRY: There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...

ELAINE: But she was fifteen.

JERRY: You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.

GEORGE: Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...

JERRY: You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.

GEORGE: Hey, now you're onto something.

JERRY: The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.

GEORGE: Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: But...somebody like Gail, though.

JERRY: Ya.

ELAINE: What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Yah-hey.

JERRY: Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.

KRAMER: Alright, I'll call her right now.

JERRY: Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)

ELAINE (to George): What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?

JERRY: Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)

KRAMER: She said she'll do it.

GEORGE: Beautiful.

JERRY: Beautiful.

KRAMER (points at Elaine's feet): But she wants the shoes.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: She says she wants those shoes.

ELAINE: She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!

JERRY: No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!

ELAINE: No, these were the last pair of these that they had!

JERRY: I'll get you another one just like it!

ELAINE: No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)

GEORGE (to Elaine, in a somber tone): Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...

ELAINE: Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -

GEORGE: Never mind!

ELAINE: Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?

KRAMER: Alright, what size are you?

ELAINE: Seven-and-a-half.

KRAMER: Eh! Bingo.



[Gail in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's. She notices Dalrymple being shown to his table.]

GAIL (hands a plate to another chef): Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)

(Russell eating at the restaurant. Jerry and George arrive. Jerry hands the shoes to Gail, and they walk over to Russell's table.)

JERRY: Hey! Whattaya know!

GEORGE: Look who's here!

JERRY: Fancy meeting you here!

RUSSELL: Oh. Hello.

GEORGE (notices Russell's lunch): Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.

JERRY: You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.

GEORGE: Didn't hear anything...

JERRY: Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.

RUSSELL: Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?

GEORGE: Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?

JERRY: No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)

ELAINE (to Russell): Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?

RUSSELL (not noticing Elaine's cleavage): Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)

GEORGE: Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)

RUSSELL: Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)

ELAINE: Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?

RUSSELL (still not noticing Elaine's cleavage): No.

ELAINE (leaning forward): Do you have a...ketchup secret?

RUSSELL: No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)

ELAINE (flirtatiously): Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)

RUSSELL (to Jerry and George, reconsidering about the pilot): Field of vision, huh?



[Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's. Gail comes over to the table.]

GAIL: How's everything?

ELAINE: Mmmm.

JERRY: Really good.

GEORGE: This pasta primavera is fabulous.

JERRY: Very tasty.

GAIL: How'd everything go with that NBC guy?

GEORGE: Great.

JERRY: The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?

ELAINE: You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.

JERRY: Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.

ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.

GEORGE: Well, it's a funny idea.

JERRY: It's funny!

GEORGE: C'mon, funny is funny.

JERRY: Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?

ELAINE: Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.

JERRY: If you can.

GEORGE: Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?

ELAINE: Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)

JERRY: I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)



[Closing Monologue]

Men are obsessed with cleavage, women are obsessed with shoes. It's the same for both sexes. It doesn't matter how many times we've seen these things, every time these objects are presented to us we have to look, we cannot not look. To men cleavage i-i-is like the nearest thing to a nearby UFO landing, that's what it is. Women if women by a pair of shoes that they really love, this is like boarding the alien ship. I think that it's entirely possible that aliens have landed and they haven't been able to get our attention because we are so preoccupied with cleavage and shoes.

I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending to be excited every time it's somebody's birthday, you know what I mean? What is the big deal? How many times do we have to celebrate that someone was born? Every year, over and over... All you did was not die for twelve months. That's all you've done, as far as I can tell. Now those astrology things where they tell you all the people that have the same birthday as you? It's always an odd group of people too, isn't it? It's like Ed Asner, Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.


[The scene opens with George dropping off his date for the night. She obviously has had a wonderful evening]

ALLISON: I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!

GEORGE: Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!

ALLISON: No... You're *something*.

GEORGE: You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!

ALLISON: You're good. You're *good*!

GEORGE: I'm bad. I'm *bad*!

ALLISON: You're *killing* me!

 
[We cut to Monk's where George, Jerry & Elaine are dining (it being a diner, and all). Jerry is over making a phone call while George & Elaine talk at the table.]

GEORGE: So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.

ELAINE: Over you?

GEORGE: Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

(Cut to Jerry who is over at the phone trying to get Sharon Leanord at NYU. Elaine and George exchange thoughts on what they got Jerry for his birthday.)

GEORGE: I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".

ELAINE: I got him a two-line phone.

(Jerry returns to the booth and explains the phone call.)

JERRY: Unbelievable! She's not there.

GEORGE: What paper does she write for?

JERRY: The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.

ELAINE: Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...

JERRY: Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...

ELAINE: [Proudly] Really?

(The camera pans out some so that we can see the three at their table and a girl sitting with her back to George at the next table. She starts to become interested in what the people behind her are talking about as Elaine pops the following philosophical dilemma to her companions)

ELAINE: Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?

JERRY: Living or all time?

ELAINE: All time.

JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

ELAINE: I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?

GEORGE: Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.

ELAINE: I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.

(Elaine notices the woman sitting behind George is eavesdropping on their conversation and discreetly alerts J+G. She decides to add some spice to the conversation. The makes sure to say it loud enough so that the spy at the next table is sure to hear... )

ELAINE: Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.

(Jerry rolls his eyes and turns away in disbelief while George on the other hand addresses Jerry directly)

GEORGE: So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.

JERRY: [indignantly] What's the matter with you?

GEORGE: [quietly] C'mon, go along...

JERRY: I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me: "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."

JERRY: Y'know I hear that all the time.

ELAINE: Hear what?

JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

ELAINE: Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.

JERRY: Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.

ELAINE: And you get along well with women.

GEORGE: I guess that leaves me in the clear...
 
(Meanwhile over at the phone booth, the eavesdropper reveals that she is one Sharon Leonard and she's calling the newspaper that she got to the diner late and missed out on meeting up with Jerry. As she's hanging up, George and Jerry make a trip to the bathroom (have two guys ever actually gone to the bathroom together? Hmmmm...)

 
[Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's unpacking groceries (no cereal to be seen) and George comes in.)

GEORGE: I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.

JERRY: Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?

GEORGE: Yeah, how did you know that?

JERRY: You told me that already like two months ago.

GEORGE: Allison bought it for me.

JERRY: How you gonna get out of *that* one?

GEORGE: I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.

(Sharon buzzes and comes up to Jerry's apartment. George decides to stay. There's a knock at the door and when Jerry answers it, the two decide if they've ever met before. It's pretty obvious Sharon remembers Jerry and George as that "funny" couple from Monk's. Jerry hasn't placed her face, however. Sharon is introduced to George and)

JERRY: He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?

SHARON: Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.

GEORGE: Jerry did you wash this pear?

JERRY: Yeah, I washed it.

GEORGE: It looks like it hasn't been washed.

JERRY: So *wash* *it*.

GEORGE: You hear the way he talks to me?

SHARON: You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...

(Again, Jerry seems confused as to what Sharon is saying. Something's not quite right... But, before another question can be asked, again George has a question-- this time for Sharon)

GEORGE: Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?

SHARON: It's nice.

GEORGE: Jerry said he didn't like it.

JERRY: I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...

GEORGE: No, you said you didn't like it...

JERRY: Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?

SHARON: So how did you two meet?

JERRY: Actually, we met in the gym locker room.

GEORGE: Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.

(George takes a hold of Jerry's leg to stress the point and Sharon, who obviously thinks she has a real story here now, asks another question:)

SHARON: Do you guys live together?

JERRY: [quizzically] Live together?

GEORGE: No, I got my own place.

(Jerry is about *this* close (picture my thumb and forefinger *really* close together) to figuring out what is going on here, when the "question fatale" is asked:)

SHARON: And do your parents know?

JERRY: Know *what*?

GEORGE: My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...

JERRY: Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!

(All three rise from the couch and a rather excited J+G try to explain things to a very confused reporter.)

JERRY: There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...

GEORGE: No, of course not...

JERRY: I mean that's fine if that's who you are...

GEORGE: Absolutely...

JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends...

GEORGE: My *father* is gay...

SHARON: Look, I know what I heard.

JERRY: It was a *joke*...

GEORGE: Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!

(Not that that approach was going to work, or anything, but what minute chance they had of convincing her is blown away as the door bursts open and:)

KRAMER: Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: No steam!

KRAMER: Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!

 
[We fast forward a couple of hours and Jerry and Elaine are talking in the apartment. Elaine offers to talk to her and Jerry reveals that he has convinced her to "think about it" before she prints anything in the NYU paper. And, for some unknown reason, Elaine refuses to take her jacket off. Kramer enters, graceful as always.]

KRAMER: Happy birthday paruba!

JERRY: Today's not my birthday.

KRAMER: Well, I beg to differ...

(Kramer convinces Jerry it's his birthday and, after Elaine refuses to take her jacket off again, Kramer presents the big guy with his present.)

JERRY: Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!

(Elaine can be seen mouthing the word "sh*t" and is, for some reason, not impressed with the gift. She picks up her purse to leave.)

JERRY: Hey, where you going?

ELAINE: I gotta go return something...

(Kramer goes to his apartment and Jerry calls him to try out the phone. And, as luck would have it, a call comes in on the other line.)

SHARON: Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry.

JERRY: Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.

GEORGE: So, what did she say?

JERRY: She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...

GEORGE: Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...

JERRY: What are you talkin' about?

GEORGE: I heard what you said: "Sharon, are you there?".

JERRY: You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?

GEORGE: Yes, I heard you!

JERRY: Well, maybe she was disconnected.

GEORGE: Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!

JERRY: Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...

KRAMER: Yello?

JERRY: Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<

GEORGE: "There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!

JERRY: Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!

GEORGE: "The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!

JERRY: Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?

GEORGE: Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...

JERRY: No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!


[We shift to Sharon's apartment where Elaine is paying a visit]

SHARON: Why don't you take a seat?

ELAINE: Thank-you.

SHARON: Why don't you take your coat off?

 
[Monk's; Jerry George and Elaine drinking coffee]

ELAINE: So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.

JERRY: She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.

GEORGE: Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!

JERRY: So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...

GEORGE: Not at all.

(Jerry tries to "forcibly remove the coat" in pursuit of some satisfaction. George springs his birthday gift on Jerry.)

GEORGE: Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!

JERRY: "Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?

GEORGE: It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".

JERRY: "The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".

(Nope. Unfortunately for Jerry, things are about to get worse. Elaine notices that there are a couple of guys pointing at Jerry from the other side of the cafe. Jerry goes to investigate.)

JERRY: What do you got there?

MAN #1: _The New York Post_, they've got an article about you.

JERRY: "Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!

GEORGE: Now everyone's going to think we're gay!

JERRY: Not that there's anything wrong with that...

GEORGE: No, not at all...


[Back in the apartment, E+G+J read from _The Post_]

JERRY: "Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!

(Kramer Enters)

KRAMER: I thought we were friends...

JERRY: Here we go...

KRAMER: I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?

JERRY: It's not true!

KRAMER: Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...

JERRY: So are you...

KRAMER: Yeah--

(It's at this point that Kramer, well, "Pulls a Kramer". He does that mini-epileptic, losing his balance, "waaaaugh" thing and he retreats to his apartment, probably to confront his own sexuality. In Jerry's apartment, the phone rings, George answers.)

GEORGE: Hello?

MRS. S: George?

GEORGE: Mrs. Seinfeld?!?

MRS. S: Oh, my God...

JERRY: Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?

MRS. S: Jerry?

JERRY: Ma!

GEORGE: Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!

 
[Back at Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld's place, the conversation continues.]

MRS. S: Jerry?

JERRY: Ma, it's not true!

MR. S: It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!

MRS. S: They weren't culottes, they were shorts.

MR. S: They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.

MRS. S: By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!

MR. S: It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!

JERRY: Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!

MRS. S: Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry.

 
[Back at the Metropolitan Hospital Center, George pays his mother a visit. She seems to be in the same bed from episode ... (yes, that includes the thin sheet covering that allowed for that infamous silhouette]

MRS. C: I open up the paper, and *this* is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move... The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!

GEORGE: It's *not* *true*!

MRS. C: Every *day* it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows *what* you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.

GEORGE: Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.

MRS. C: Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it.

GEORGE: Of course not...

(In comes a hulking male nurse. He parts the screen and announces)

NURSE: 6:30, Scott. Time for your sponge bath.

(Ack! It's deja vu all over again! Except instead of a couple of women behind the screen (as in the "M" episode), there are two guys. George is transfixed. Mrs. C. has to scream to get his attention off of the "show" going on beside him.)


[at Monk's, E+G+J converge yet again. Jerry informs G+E that Sharon has left a message on his machine. George has other things on his mind.]

GEORGE: Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?

(Before Jerry can utter his response, a military guy approaches the table.)

SAILOR: Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.

(And, just as quickly as he appeared, he leaves before Jerry can respond (Colonel Flagg, anyone?) He does have an answer to George's previous question, though.)

JERRY: Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...

(George throws a "hissy fit" and it told to pipe down by a rather bulky manager from the diner and resolves to take Elaine instead. Elaine then queries George if Allison has seen the article yet.)

GEORGE: No. Just imagine her reaction.

ELAINE: Yeah...

GEORGE: Oh, my God...

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!


[So, we flash forward to George dropping off Allison. She is mulling over the article that George has given her.]

ALLISON: Yeah? So?

GEORGE: Yeah so??

ALLISON: Well this is nice. They mention your name.

GEORGE: Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?

ALLISON: No, what?

GEORGE: I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.

ALLISON: You're *gay*?

GEORGE: Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.

ALLISON: [matter-of-factly] I don't believe it.

GEORGE: You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.

ALLISON: I will.

GEORGE: What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.

ALLISON: [Grabs George's lapels] I want to hear it from *Jerry*...


[Back at Jerry's apartment, Sharon and Jerry are, well, "making out on the couch". Apparently, she's all turned around on the subject.]

SHARON: Oh, can you ever forgive me?

JERRY: I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...

SHARON: Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.

JERRY: I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.

(George Enters)

GEORGE: Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!

JERRY: What!?

GEORGE: You're with a *woman*!

JERRY: I know! What are you doin' here?!?

GEORGE: I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!

JERRY: [forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!

SHARON: What's going on?

ALLISON: Yeah, what's going on?

GEORGE: Alright, tell her. Go ahead.

JERRY: Tell her what?

GEORGE: Y'know. About *us*.

(George has emphasized his point by reaching up and putting his hand in J's hair. Jerry flips out at this point. His arms are flailing about and he's well, gone loopy. George embraces Jerry to keep it going, but Jerry's not buying any of it. Sharon leaves, much to Jerry's chagrin. Allison asks (again) for an explanation.)

GEORGE: Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.

ALLISON: *Really*?

(Allison takes George's arm (not quite the reaction he wanted, I'm sure). Kramer walks by the open door to go to his apartment. He is escorted by what appears to be a virile young man. Kramer addresses G+J (and Allison) before he goes into his apartment.)

KRAMER: We'll see you later...

(George & Jerry look disbelievingly at each other, obviously at a loss for words over Kramer's new, interest. Kramer notices this and)

KRAMER: He's the *phone* man!

(George + Jerry see the light and are visibly relieved)

KRAMER: Not that there's anything wrong with that...


[Closing Monologue]

I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this: "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum: "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."

[Open at Monk's, with Jerry & George just sittin' around. Jerry is reading the paper while George reflects on things]

GEORGE: Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?

JERRY: Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...

GEORGE: Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.

JERRY: Yeah, how about a mute?

GEORGE: A mute would be good.

JERRY: Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?

GEORGE: This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.

(George quickly shifts into deep philosophical mode. Jerry remains pedestrian on the issue, still reading the paper.)

GEORGE: I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...

JERRY: A deep, yawning chasm...

GEORGE: There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?

JERRY: Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.

(Elaine enters and greets George & Jerry cheerfully.)

ELAINE: Hey boys!

JERRY: Hey! How you doin'?

ELAINE: Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.

GEORGE: Start what?

ELAINE: I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.

GEORGE: *Really*.

ELAINE: Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.

GEORGE: Volunteer work, huh?

JERRY: What're you gonna do down there?

ELAINE: Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.

JERRY: That's what I do with him [points at George]

(George gives Jerry that "Oh, ha-ha... it is to laugh" look and probes Elaine further (no, that's not a euphemism for those who are wondering.)

GEORGE: When did you get this idea?

ELAINE: Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.

JERRY: What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?

GEORGE: And... and anybody can do this?

ELAINE: Yup.

GEORGE: Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!

ELAINE: [To Jerry] What about you?

JERRY: Nah, it's not for me.

ELAINE: Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.

GEORGE: What *kind* of a person are you?

JERRY: I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.


[We skip forward to the apartment where a representative from the senior citizens office is giving George & Jerry their information sheets on their volunteer cases.]

AGENCY REP: This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.

GEORGE: Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.

AGENCY REP: Good luck.

JERRY: Thank you.

(The rep leaves and George & Jerry compare information sheets)

GEORGE: Hey, what's your guy's name again?

JERRY: Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?

GEORGE: Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?

JERRY: *We*? No.

(Enter Kramer)

KRAMER: So what's up, Diggity Dog?

JERRY: George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.

KRAMER: Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.

JERRY: What're you talkin' about?

KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.

JERRY: Where do you *get* this?

KRAMER: The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.

(Before Kramer can get too far into his tale, a commotion is going on outside the door at Kramer's apartment. Someone's knockin' on his door.)

NEWMAN: Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?

KRAMER: I'm in here. C'mon...

JERRY: Hello, *Newman*...

NEWMAN: Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?

KRAMER: Well--

JERRY: What records?

KRAMER: Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.

(Kramer and Newman do what I can only assume is some sort of Secret Hand Shake (like the Moose lodge).)

NEWMAN: You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!

KRAMER: Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--

KRAMER: Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.

(Before Jerry issues a response, George needs his curiousity satisfied.)

GEORGE: Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?

NEWMAN: I'm a United States postal worker.

GEORGE: Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?

NEWMAN: Sometimes...

JERRY: Why *is* that?

NEWMAN: Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!

(Newman is restrained by the boys, but on the bright side, Jerry has allowed Kramer & Newman to take whatever records they want from his bedroom. We shift to the record shop, but the sign says "Bleeker Bob's Records" (Continuity alert! Continuity alert!) The clerk (presumably Ron) files through Kramer & Newman's stash carefully and somehow comes to his total without a calculator)

RON: I'll give you five bucks.

KRAMER: Five bucks???

NEWMAN: Well, you know how much those records are worth!?

RON: Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars.

NEWMAN: Those records are worth more than five dollars!

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...

NEWMAN: You're gyppin' us!

RON: Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got "Don Ho: Live At Honolulu", you got "Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs" you got Sergio Mendes, now come on...

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.

NEWMAN: They follow him like a cult.

KRAMER: He can't even walk down the street in South America...

RON: Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] I don't like it...

NEWMAN: I don't like it.

RON: Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.

NEWMAN: Alright, well be back... *jack*!


[At the home of Sid Field, Sid sits in an armchair while his housekeeper answers the door. Sid is not the jolly fellow one might associate with someone of his mellowing years]

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.

HOUSEKEEPER: Agency?

JERRY: Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?

HOUSEKEEPER: Sid Fields.

(The Housekeeper points over to the E-Z Chair where Sid is sitting. He welcomes Jerry into his home.)

SID: What the *Hell* is it?

JERRY: Mr. Fields?

SID: What!?!

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.

SID: Agency? What agency? The *CIA*?

JERRY: No, no, the--

SID: Who let you in here?

JERRY: The woman, she--

SID: Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' "voo-doo" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house...

JERRY: Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.

SID: Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!? [Jerry gets out card]

JERRY: No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--

SID: I can't read that you fool...

(Jerry is in the pocket and he's in trouble. Attempting to avoid the sack he scrambles and picks another topic to switch to. There are a couple of piles of records on top of the TV. Jerry asks about them.)

JERRY: What's all this stuff?

SID: Trash. Garbage.

JERRY: You're throwin' this out??

SID: I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.

(You can make out the albums pretty clearly. One is an apparent K-Tel "classic": "22 Explosive Hits", I don't know the other one. Anyone? I believe "The Beatles" (The White Album) is there also.)

JERRY: You don't want any of this?

SID: Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*.

JERRY: You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.

SID: Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.

(They've bonded. Just like in all those buddy-cop movies. This seemingly non-compatible couple have found common ground. They've reached each other)

JERRY: Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...

SID: With you? I'd rather be dead.

JERRY: Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.

SID: Good. Thank God. Good riddance. [pause] Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!


[At Monk's, George and his charge enjoy a bowl of soup over some, er, light conversation.]

BEN: No, I feel great for 85.

GEORGE: Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.

BEN: I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.

GEORGE: You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...

BEN: I'm grateful for every moment I have.

GEORGE: Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...

BEN: I guess I just don't care.

GEORGE: What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!

(Ben gets up to leave)

GEORGE: Wait a second, where are you going?

BEN: Life's too short to waste on you.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, please--

BEN: Get out of my way...

(As Ben shoves George out of the way, all of a sudden you just *have* to feel a tinge of pain in your heart as you realize George realizes he won't be able to talk to Ben anymore)

GEORGE: But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...


[The apartment of Elaine's senior citizen. It's very dark in the apartment.]

ELAINE: Mrs. Oliver?

MRS. O: Yes my dear.

(Elaine looks around the room, trying to find Mrs. Oliver. She pans around and wham-o!! She sees that Mrs. Oliver has a rather, er, um, unsightly physical problem (to put it mildly)

ELAINE: Ooh!

MRS. O: What's the trouble? Are you alright?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

MRS. O: It's my goiter, isn't it?

ELAINE: Did you say goiter? What goiter?

MRS. O: This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.

ELAINE: Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...

MRS. O: Does it bother you?

ELAINE: Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.


[At Jerry's apartment, the kids compare notes on their visits.]

JERRY: C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...

ELAINE: I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there: "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.

JERRY: They really should mention that in the breakdown: height, weight, goiter.

ELAINE: Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.

JERRY: Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.

ELAINE: Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?

GEORGE: I don't think it's gonna work out...

JERRY: Whattya mean?

GEORGE: He fired me.

JERRY: He fired you?!?

ELAINE: *How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?

GEORGE: I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!

JERRY: Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.

ELAINE: I wish I could quit...

JERRY: So quit!

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.

(Kramer and Newman come in, albums in hand)

KRAMER: Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]

JERRY: What happened?

NEWMAN: Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.

KRAMER: Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.

NEWMAN: That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.

JERRY: Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...

KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!

(Elaine relieves herself of the conversation by going to the bathroom)

JERRY: Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away: Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??

JERRY: Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.

KRAMER: Okay...

NEWMAN: [In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!

KRAMER: Yeah...

JERRY: But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.

KRAMER: Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...

(George peeks up from the magazine he's reading on the couch)

GEORGE: Senegal?


[At Mr. Fields' apartment, George is helping the housekeeper put away some groceries. He takes this time to get to know her better]

GEORGE: So you don't speak *any* English at all?

HOUSEKEEPER: English? No.

SID: Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?

JERRY: Well you said they could come and take the records.

SID: It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.

GEORGE: You don't speak *any* English?

HOUSEKEEPER: No English.

GEORGE: I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!

JERRY: So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--

SID: Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here.

KRAMER: Now calm down, Mr. Fields...

SID: Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...

KRAMER: Oooow! He's biting me!

(Kramer's defense mechanism kicks in and when he rips his arm away from Sid's jaws of death, something flies away from the scrum)

SID: My teeth! My teeth!

JERRY: Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!

GEORGE: I thought I saw something fly over here...

JERRY: Well turn the light on...

(George flicks the light switch by the kitchen sink)

JERRY: That's the garbage disposal!

SID: My teeth! You idiots!!!

(The boys decide to take Sid to the dentist to get new teeth, or something but on the way to the cab, somebody forgot to stay with Mr. Fields. They go back to find him, but they can't, apparently.)


[Cut to Mrs. Oliver's place where Elaine is sitting, bored out of her skull through a very pedestrian conversation. She keeps mumbling to herself throughout Mrs. Oliver's story]

MRS. O: And we would take long automobile trips--

ELAINE: Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...

MRS. O: Staring out the window--

ELAINE: Uh huh...

MRS. O: You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--

ELAINE: Well, that'll get you goin' right there...

MRS. O: Big, roaming cows--

ELAINE: Cows, well that's fascinating...

MRS. O: That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.

ELAINE: What?

MRS. O: Mohandas.

ELAINE: Ghandhi?

MRS. O: Oh, the *passion*. The *forbidden pleasure*--

ELAINE: You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O: He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]

ELAINE: Oh, my God... The Mohatma?


[Meanwhile, back at Bleeker Bob's, er, I mean, Ron's on Bleeker, Kramer and Newman have brought Ron the clerk "something decent".]

RON: Twenty bucks.

NEWMAN: Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?

RON: Well, take it or leave it.

NEWMAN: Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!

RON: Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing "Mammy". Heh heh heh...

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...

NEWMAN: You are nothing but a piece of crap.

RON: Pardon me?

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...

NEWMAN: A piece of crap.

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...

NEWMAN: I find you extremely ugly.

RON: *Do* you?

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...

NEWMAN: You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.

RON: Oh, is that right?

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...

NEWMAN: I *loathe* you.

RON: That's it. Get out of my store!

KRAMER: [In Newman's ear] Make us.

NEWMAN: Make us!

RON: Oh, I'll make you!

(As Ron jumps the counter to get at the boys, we cut to Jerry's apartment where it seems he is being lectured)

AGENCY REP: Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.

JERRY: Yes, but--

(buzzer)

JERRY: [Into intercom] Yes?

TIM: It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.

JERRY: Alright, c'mon up.

JERRY: [To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.

AGENCY REP: Why were you taking him to the dentist?

JERRY: Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--

AGENCY REP: What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?

JERRY: Well, after he bit my friend--

AGENCY REP: Bit your friend?!

% Tim comes into the apartment to temporarily get Jerry off the hook.

TIM: What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!

JERRY: I, I'm sorry.

TIM: And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?

JERRY: Well, I brought them up there to take his records--

TIM: Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?


[Kramer and Newman come into the apartment.]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: There you are. Did you find him?

KRAMER: No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.

NEWMAN: It was a real melee.

KRAMER: Yeah, a real brouhaha...

(They inform all that the records are broken, but before Tim can get *really* out of control, they try to call Mr. Fields at home, but the line is busy, so they go to his apartment figuring he must be home. As they all get there, they come upon a rather)

(Scene of George on couch with the maid rubbing oil on his head.)

The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'


[Opening scene]

(Sidra on a Stairmaster at the New York Health Club. Jerry enters after his workout w/gymbag in hand.)

SIDRA: Oh, hi Jerry.

JERRY: Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.

SIDRA (amused): Really.

JERRY: Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.

SIDRA (stepping off): Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.

JERRY: Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?

SIDRA: Thursday night.

JERRY: Alright.

(Elaine walks over to Jerry.)

ELAINE: Good workout?

JERRY (mimics smoking an "after sex cigarette"): Tremendous workout.

ELAINE: That's a pretty girl.

JERRY: Tremendous girl.

ELAINE: She's the one you went out with last night?

JERRY: Yeah. I really like her.

ELAINE: You know, uh...they're fake.

JERRY: What? Don't say that!

ELAINE: Nah! They're fake!

JERRY: How do you know?

ELAINE: I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?

JERRY: I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)

ELAINE: Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?

JERRY: Yes, they do!

ELAINE: I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.

JERRY: A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.

ELAINE: I don't want to see her naked.

JERRY: Well, I do.

ELAINE: Well, that's your problem.

JERRY: Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.

ELAINE: Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?

JERRY: Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!

ELAINE: But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!

JERRY: Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.

ELAINE: What's his problem?

JERRY: Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.

ELAINE: Wrong side?

JERRY: Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.

ELAINE: He can't go left.

JERRY: No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?

ELAINE: Nah, we just play defense.


[New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.]

GEORGE: Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?

BETSY: Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.

GEORGE: I'll shout.

BETSY: Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.

GEORGE: C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?

BETSY: What? (The phone rings.)

GEORGE (attempting to make a move): No, no, the machine'll get it...

BETSY: No, no, it's not on...

GEORGE: They'll call back.

BETSY: But George, what if it's an emergency?

GEORGE: In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?

BETSY: George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!

GEORGE: Alright, maybe four.


[New scene - Elaine at the health club, in the sauna with Sidra and some other women. We hear her thoughts.]

ELAINE's brain: Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.


[Cut back to George and Betsy at her apartment. Betsy's still on the phone.]

BETSY: So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)


[New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: You're sure?

ELAINE: Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.

JERRY: Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.

ELAINE: What? Just 'cause of that?

JERRY: Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!

ELAINE: Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?

JERRY: You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.

ELAINE: You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?

JERRY: Well, I take it very seriously.

ELAINE: You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.

KRAMER: Well, I know what they feel like.

JERRY: You? How do you know?

KRAMER: Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.

ELAINE (laughs): I thought you hated Los Angeles.

KRAMER: I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.

JERRY: Real busy now down at the office?

KRAMER: No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.

ELAINE (laughing): Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.


[New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.]

GEORGE: I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.

JERRY: You put her on a pedestal.

KRAMER: I put them on a dental chair.

JERRY: He puts 'em on a dental chair.

GEORGE: I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.

KRAMER: Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.

GEORGE: That's funny. You're a funny guy.

JERRY: Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?

GEORGE: Why, you think I should?

JERRY: What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!

GEORGE: I'm the consolation guy...?

KRAMER: Consolation Guy is big.

JERRY: Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.

KRAMER: It's like ten dates in one shot.

JERRY: This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!

GEORGE: It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.

KRAMER: Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.

GEORGE: Really?

KRAMER: In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!

(George considers.)


[New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.]

ELAINE's brain: Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.

(Sidra enters the sauna with a friend.)

ELAINE's brain: Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."

SIDRA (to her friend): So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.

ELAINE: Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.

SIDRA: Oh, that's o.k.

ELAINE: Did he give you a reason?

SIDRA: Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.

ELAINE: Really?

SIDRA: He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.

ELAINE: Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?

SIDRA: Yes! How did you know?

ELAINE: Oh, I know the type.

SIDRA: So you can relate?

ELAINE: Oh, yeah.

SIDRA (sits across from Elaine and takes her towel off): You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

ELAINE: Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")


[New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.

JERRY: You fell on her?

ELAINE: I touched 'em.

JERRY: You what?

ELAINE: I...touched...'em.

JERRY: You touched 'em?!

ELAINE: I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!

JERRY: Wow.

ELAINE: Anyway...they're real.

JERRY: Excuse me?!

ELAINE: I think they might be real.

JERRY: Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.

ELAINE: I've touched mine!

JERRY: So have I.

ELAINE: Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)

JERRY: Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.

ELAINE: Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.

JERRY: Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)


[New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.]

GEORGE (to clerk): You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.

CLERK (to Kramer): Oh, I'm very sorry.

KRAMER: I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...

CLERK: You poor thing!

KRAMER (breaking into tears): I...I...

GEORGE: You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.

CLERK: You're a good friend.

GEORGE: I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?

CLERK: Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.

GEORGE: The death certificate?

CLERK: Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.

GEORGE: What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?

CLERK: I know! But it happens.

GEORGE: You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?

CLERK: That would be $387 round-trip.

KRAMER (in a perfectly normal tone of voice): Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?

CLERK: Yes.


[Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!

ELAINE: Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.

JERRY: But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?

ELAINE: I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!

JERRY: Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: Hey. George off to Detroit?

KRAMER: Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.

ELAINE: Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.

KRAMER: Pffft - wrong.


[New scene - Kramer and Jerry at the health club. They see "Salman Rushdie" talking to Sidra.]

JERRY: There's Sidra.

KRAMER: There's Salman.

JERRY: Where?

KRAMER: Talkin' to that woman.

JERRY: Talkin' to Sidra?

KRAMER: If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.

JERRY: I don't think that's Salman.

KRAMER: Well, I don't think they're real.

JERRY: If that's Rushdie, they're real.

KRAMER: If they're real, that's Rushdie.

JERRY: Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.

KRAMER: I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.


[New scene - Kramer and "Salman" sitting in the sauna together.]

KRAMER: It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.

"SALMAN": You've lived in the desert?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?

"SALMAN": Yes, I've been there.

KRAMER: My name's Kramer.

"SALMAN" (shakes Kramer's hand): Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer.

KRAMER: So, uh...what kind of work do you do?

"SALMAN": I'm a writer.


[New scene - George and Betsy at Aunt Clarice's wake in Detroit.]

BETSY (to Aunt May): Have you met my boyfriend George?

AUNT MAY: No! (shakes George's hand.)

BETSY: George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George.

AUNT MAY: Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.

GEORGE: Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.

AUNT MAY: Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?

BETSY: I'm not very hungry.

AUNT MAY: They have some very nice snacks.

FATHER JESSUP: I'm about to get myself a snack.

(Betsy starts to go for a snack.)

GEORGE: Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.

(George goes into the other room and meets Father Jessup.)

FATHER JESSUP: This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.

GEORGE (loading up his plate with sandwiches): Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)

FATHER JESSUP: You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.

GEORGE: Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?


[New scene - Jerry and Kramer entering Jerry's apartment after returning from the health club.]

KRAMER: C'mon Jerry!

JERRY: Oh, how can you be so sure?

KRAMER: Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!

JERRY: Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!

KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!

JERRY: Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...

KRAMER: What, did you ask her?

JERRY: I'm gonna find out tonight.

KRAMER (nods): Oh, yes indeed...


[Cut back to George at the wake in Detroit.]

DR. ALLENWOOD: Why do you need a death certificate?

GEORGE: Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.

DR. ALLENWOOD: Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.

GEORGE: Oh, that would be wonderful.

DR. ALLENWOOD: It was very nice meeting you, George.

GEORGE: Likewise.

(George walks over to the snack table as Timmy watches him from across the room. He takes a chip from the bowl, dips it, takes a bite, and then dips again. Timmy hurriedly comes over.)

TIMMY: What are you doing?

GEORGE: What?

TIMMY: Did...did you just double-dip that chip?

GEORGE: Excuse me?

TIMMY: You double-dipped the chip!

GEORGE: "Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?

TIMMY: You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again.

GEORGE: So...?

TIMMY: That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!

GEORGE: Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)

TIMMY: Oh, you don't, huh?

GEORGE: No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)

TIMMY: Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.)


[New scene - Night-time; Jerry and Sidra in Jerry's apartment.]

SIDRA: I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)

JERRY: Hey, would you mind switching seats?

SIDRA: Why?

JERRY: Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.

SIDRA: O.K....(they switch places.)

JERRY: How ya doin'?

SIDRA: Good. How you doin'?

JERRY: Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.

SIDRA: I hear that's how she died.

JERRY: Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.

SIDRA: Well, a lot of women are having them done.

JERRY: Really?

SIDRA: Yeah.

JERRY: How do you like that.

SIDRA: A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.

JERRY: Aw, you know people.

SIDRA: It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.

JERRY: Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.

SIDRA: What do you tell them?

JERRY: Whatever you want me to tell them.

SIDRA: Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?

JERRY: No.

SIDRA: What if it's an emergency?

JERRY: Oh, there's no emergency...

KRAMER (in hallway): Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!

JERRY: Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!

KRAMER: Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.

JERRY: This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?

KRAMER: Well, I like yours.

JERRY: I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.

KRAMER: C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?

JERRY: Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.

KRAMER: Alright, c'mon!

JERRY: Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: Hi, Jer.

JERRY: Oh, hi, Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh...hi, Sidra -

SIDRA: Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)

JERRY (to Elaine): What are you doing here?

ELAINE: I'm looking for Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?

JERRY: Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?

SIDRA: I was just leaving.

JERRY: Right, you were leaving.

SIDRA: I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.

JERRY: That was an accident!

SIDRA: I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)


[Cut back to an exterior shot of the funeral home in Detroit. We hear the commotion of George and Timmy fighting.]

BETSY: Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!

DR. ALLENWOOD: Go back to New York! Get out!


[New scene of a disheveled George at the airport in Detroit, talking to Clerk no. 2.]

CLERK 2: Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way.

GEORGE: Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)

CLERK 2: What's this?

GEORGE: That's a picture of me next to the coffin.

(We see a photo of George standing next to a coffin.)

CLERK 2: Nice try.

GEORGE: Not even close, huh?

JERRY: You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin'  Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
 
 

[Jerry's apartment, Jerry's unloading groceries.]

GEORGE: You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?

JERRY: (flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.

GEORGE: (laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?

JERRY: Tonight.

GEORGE: What's her name?

JERRY: I... don't... know...

GEORGE: How could you not know her name?

JERRY: I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...

(Jerry interrupts himself to pick up a pile of black bananas on his counter)

JERRY: Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...

(Tosses the bananas back in the bowl and goes back to unpacking the grocery bag.)

GEORGE: Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.

JERRY: Yeah, I did that too.

GEORGE: Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!

JERRY: Wow!

GEORGE: Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...

JERRY: Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.

GEORGE: Really? Who?

JERRY: Nobody you know...

GEORGE: Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...

JERRY: Why don't you put it in the *bank*?

GEORGE: The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!

JERRY: *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...

(Kramer Enters. Jerry flips him a pack of dishwashing gloves he picked up for him at the grocery store.)

KRAMER: Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.

JERRY: Yes I did.

KRAMER: Yes.

GEORGE: What's with the gloves?

KRAMER: Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...

GEORGE: Huh. What, the whole apartment?

KRAMER: The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.

JERRY: Wood is good.

KRAMER: Definitely.

JERRY: So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.

JERRY: O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.

KRAMER: Yep.

[Kramer exits]

JERRY: What, you rented "Home Alone"?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: I thought you saw that already...

GEORGE: No, I saw "Home Alone II".

JERRY: Oh, right... But you *hated* it!

GEORGE: Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.

JERRY: All right.. Go ahead.

[Intercom buzzes - Jerry walks over to answer it.  George puts the tape in the VCR.]

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: (on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?

JERRY: No. Come on up.

[Kramer enters wearing the gloves Jerry got him.]

KRAMER: I can't work with these!

JERRY: What's wrong?

KRAMER: Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...

JERRY: You said "gloves"...

KRAMER: No, no, these are too thick.  (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)

KRAMER: Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?

GEORGE: Yeah. The *original*.

(Elaine Enters)

ELAINE: Hey Boys-O!

EVERYONE: (in unison) Heyyyyyyyy.

KRAMER: Hey, how's it goin'?

ELAINE: Hello.

JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.

(Kramer get up to leave, but)

ELAINE: Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: eh, Remember Roy, the artist?

JERRY: Oh, the "triangle" guy.

ELAINE: Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.

JERRY: Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?

ELAINE: Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...

JERRY: Artsy?

ELAINE: Fat.

JERRY: Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)

ELAINE: He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.

JERRY: What's wrong with him?

ELAINE: Unh, something with his spleen.  Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.

KRAMER: Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)

JERRY: All right we'll wait for you.

KRAMER: Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.

[Kramer exits]

ELAINE: Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.

JERRY: Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.

ELAINE: Well...

JERRY: Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.

ELAINE: Aha ha ha (laugh)

[Kramer enters, standing in the open doorway holding a sports bag]

KRAMER: All right, lets go.

JERRY: All right (picks up his sports bag)

KRAMER: Yep yep yep.

(Elaine notices George is staying behind)

ELAINE: What's with him?

JERRY: Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
 
 

[EXTERIOR shot of the hospital with cars driving by -- then INTERIOR of Roy's hospital room.  Roy is lying in bed, resting. At the Hospital, Elaine and Jerry enter -- finding the triangle? man's room]

ELAINE: Roy!

ROY: *Elaine*! What a *surprise*.  (sitting up)

ELAINE: (gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...

ROY: Yeah, ya know, I've lost some weight...

ELAINE: A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)

ROY: I know.

ELAINE: Aha hu, You look *terrific*.

ROY: Thank you. So do you.

ELAINE: Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)

(Elaine introduces Jerry the boyfriend? to Roy)

ELAINE: Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.

ROY: Thank you.

(Since Elaine is preoccupied, thinking about Roy, Jerry takes it upon himself to be introduced and sticks out his hand.)

JERRY: Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
 
 

[While Roy, Elaine and Jerry are talking -- Kramer is out in the hallway looking for some thinner gloves on a hospital cart.]

HOSPITAL VOICEOVER: Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call. Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call.

(Kramer opens a door)

WOMAN: AHAaaaaaaaaa!  (scream)

KRAMER: (a bit startled) Ahh.

(he takes a few steps down the hallway and sees another door to try).

HOSPITAL VOICEOVER: Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call.

KRAMER: Ah, the mother lode!  (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
 
 

[George sits on the couch in the darkened apartment -- watching Home Alone, and eating a bag of popcorn -- 6 seconds of funny dramatic music from the movie play during the scene]
 
 

[Back in Roy's room, Elaine is sitting on the bed, close to Roy -- Jerry sits in a chair in the corner]

ELAINE: I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...

ROY: Yesss, I remember.

ELAINE: Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.

ROY: Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.

ELAINE: Me?

ROY: (quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.

ELAINE: *Get* *out*!

ROY: Really, it's the truth.

ELAINE: Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...

JERRY: That's terrible...

ELAINE: I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.

(Jerry gets up and starts playing with a Yo-Yo)

ROY: You did.

JERRY: You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)

ELAINE: Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?

ROY: Next Thursday.

ELAINE: Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...

[Jerry the boyfriend? seems to have a problem with this -- and the two exchange in a banter as they speak to each other in super-polite, higher-pitched voices.]

JERRY: Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?

ELAINE: No that's the week after.

JERRY: No, I believe it's next week.

ELAINE: You're wrong.

JERRY: No I'm not...

ELAINE: Shut up...

(Kramer comes back in the room with a mitt full o' gloves.)

KRAMER: Pay dirt!  (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)

ELAINE: Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.

ROY: Oh, How do you do?

KRAMER: Yeah... I do great, yeah.

[Roy's doctor enters the room.]

DOCTOR: Hi Roy.

ROY: Oh, hey Dr. Siegel.

JERRY: Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]

KRAMER: Heey.

JERRY: I *just* learned that.  (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)

DOCTOR:  A-hu. (The doctor is at a loss)

DOCTOR: I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.

KRAMER: Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?

DOCTOR: Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?

KRAMER: I sure am.

DOCTOR: Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.

KRAMER: But you *will* use... a retractor.

DOCTOR: We have to...

KRAMER: Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)

DOCTOR: Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?

KRAMER: I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!

JERRY: I dunno...

KRAMER: Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...

JERRY: Yeah, that's true...

KRAMER: ...They'll saw through bone.  Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
 
 

[Jerry's apartment. George is finishing watching the movie, music playing -- he is crying]

GEORGE: Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.

[Jerry enters]

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hi...

JERRY: What are doing, you crying??

GEORGE: No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)

JERRY: You crying from "Home Alone"??

GEORGE: The old man got to me.

JERRY: Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.

GEORGE: Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)

JERRY: Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.

GEORGE: Oh. How's the guy?

JERRY: Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)

GEORGE: Hnh. That's nerve...

JERRY: Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)

GEORGE: Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome."  He falls ill; she falls in love.

JERRY: You mean Florence Nightingale. **
(** Footnote: see short bio at end of script **)

GEORGE: What'd I say? Clara?

JERRY: Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
(** Footnote: see short bio at end of script **)

GEORGE: Clara Barton? What did she do?

JERRY: I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)

GEORGE: Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
(** Footnote: see short bio at end of script **)

JERRY: Yeah, I think you would.

GEORGE: So, you gonna buy his art?

JERRY: No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.

JERRY: I will.

GEORGE: Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.

JERRY: No, it isn't. I can find out.

GEORGE: Yeah? How?

JERRY: There are ways.
 
 

[Later, the mystery woman and Jerry are sitting on the couch]

JERRY: Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...

WOMAN: "Seinsmelled"?

JERRY: Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?

WOMAN: Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?

(They both laugh, she leans in and kisses his ear and they hug. Jerry looks confused.  She leans back --)

WOMAN: (con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.

(They embrace and a couple of light kisses and a hug)

WOMAN: Oh, oh Jerry...

JERRY: Oh... *you*...
 
 

[Exterior shot of Monks Restaurant then inside to Jerry and George sitting in the usual  booth.  Seems like it's the next day -- they're in the middle of a conversation when we join them.]

GEORGE: Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Rest... Sest... Hest...

JERRY: "Hest"? That's not a name.

GEORGE: What, you should've just asked her.

JERRY: I know, I should've asked her.

GEORGE: What're you gonna do now?

JERRY: I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.

GEORGE: Aretha!  (points finger at Jerry)

JERRY: No...

GEORGE: Bovary!  (points finger again at Jerry)

JERRY: Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)

GEORGE: Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...

JERRY: How am I gonna do that?

GEORGE: When she goes to the bathroom.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?

JERRY: You asked a date to go to the operation?

KRAMER: Yeah... So c'mon,  (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?

GEORGE: What kind of operation is it?

KRAMER: Spleenectomy.

GEORGE: Isn't that where they remove the--

KRAMER: No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?

GEORGE: Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)

JERRY: Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)

KRAMER: C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JERRY: Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
 
 

[Exterior of the hospital then cut to the operating room where Jerry and Kramer, dressed in green scrubs and head cover, are seated in the front row of the viewing gallery directly overlooking the table below. There's no glass in front of them, so they can look right over the edge.  Several students are also in the gallery behind them.  The sounds of beep, beep, beep from the heart monitor, and the breathing from the patients oxygen mask are a constant throughout the scene]

DOCTOR: Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.

(Kramer gets a box of candy out and pours a few into his hand and starts to munch)

JERRY: What are you eating?

KRAMER: Junior Mints. Do you want one?

JERRY: No...

KRAMER: Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst...

(The entire surgical team stops and looks up at him. Kramer motions to a nurse to get out of the way so he can see.)

KRAMER: ... Cou, ye, ge...

(The doctor shakes his head in disbelief and returns to the surgical procedure)

KRAMER: Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)

JERRY: Where'd you get those?

KRAMER: The machine. You want one?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Here, take one.

JERRY: I don't want one.

KRAMER: No, they're good! Take one..

JERRY: I don't want any!

KRAMER: Just take one.

JERRY: No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!

[As they struggle to force the Junior Mint on each other, Jerry pushes Kramers' hand away and -- in slow motion with the sound of a beating heart to emphasize the event -- The Junior Mint is launched into the air towards the operating table and, well, in a word: "Bingo" -- with a small "splat" sound -- falls into Roy, the patient.  The surgical team looks around puzzled as to what just happened -- but they continue on with the operation)

[Jerry and Kramer look around at the other students and at each other in amazement as to what just happened]

JERRY: (pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?

KRAMER: Ge--

(Camera fade to black with familiar Seinfeld music)
 
 

[Jerry's apartment where he is obviously relating the day's events to George.]

JERRY: ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!

GEORGE: What do you mean "into the patient"?

JERRY: Into the patient, *literally*!

GEORGE: Into the hole?

JERRY: Yes, the hole!

GEORGE: Didn't they notice it?

JERRY: No!

GEORGE: How could they not notice it?!?

JERRY: Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.

GEORGE: W-ca-What did they do?

JERRY: They sealed him up with the mint inside.

GEORGE: They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.

JERRY: Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!

[Intercom buzzes - Jerry answers it.  George goes to the fridge]

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

[Kramer enters with a sheet of the wood? wallpaper]

KRAMER: Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!

JERRY: Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!

KRAMER: Well, I didn't believe you.

JERRY: How could you not believe me?!?

KRAMER: Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!

JERRY: That's true.

KRAMER: It's very refreshing!

JERRY: Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...

[Elaine enters the apartment, looking forlorn and morose...]

ELAINE: Prognosis... negative.

JERRY: Prognosis *negative*!?

ELAINE: He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.

JERRY and KRAMER: Oh, my God...

ELAINE: Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.

GEORGE: It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)

ELAINE: Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)

GEORGE: Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...

JERRY: We gotta confess.

KRAMER: Really?

JERRY: Yes!

KRAMER: We could be tried for murder...

JERRY: I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
(** Footnote: see short bio at end of script **)

KRAMER: You're not gonna say anything, you got that?

JERRY: I'm telling and you can't stop me!

KRAMER: You're *not*!!!

(Elaine comes out of the bathroom -- just in time before Jerry and Kramer resort to fisticuffs).

GEORGE: Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.

[Kramer, Jerry and Elaine look at George like they can't believe he would do that.  George raises a toast? with his glass of milk.  He has a large sandwich in his other hand.]
 
 

[Later, at Jerry's apartment, the Mystery Woman gives him a massage.]

JERRY: Oh yeah, that's the spot...

WOMAN: What're you so tense about?

JERRY: Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.

WOMAN: What?

JERRY: Mulva?

WOMAN: Mulva?

JERRY: Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.

WOMAN: huh.

JERRY: Yeah.

WOMAN: Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

JERRY: Oh, good idea...

(She walks into the bathroom and closes the door.  Jerry gets up quickly and opens her purse to look for an ID, but she comes back suddenly, catching him with the open purse.)

WOMAN: What are you doing?

JERRY: Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.

WOMAN: Oh, I have Junior Mints.

JERRY: No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...

(She turns and walks back into the bathroom taking her purse with her.)

(Stealthy Kramer enters the apartment)

KRAMER: Any news?

JERRY: [whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.

KRAMER: Oh.

JERRY: Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.

KRAMER: 10-4.

JERRY: O.K. (closes the apartment door)

WOMAN: Oh, hello.

KRAMER: Hello, I'm Kramer.

WOMAN: Nice to meet you.

KRAMER: See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)

WOMAN: Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)

JERRY: Oh, okay.

WOMAN: Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.

JERRY: Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.

WOMAN: Mm. Bye Jerry.

JERRY: Bye.

[They kiss.  She turns and opens the door to leave. In the hallway, George is just reaching for the door knob as she opens the door. He has three more videos with him to watch at Jerry's -- the movie on top looks to be "Pretty Woman", in which Jason Alexander plays an evil lawyer)

WOMAN: Oh, hi.

GEORGE: Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)

WOMAN: Oh, Nice to meet you, George.

[She leaves]

GEORGE: Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"?  (puts a video in the VCR)

JERRY: No, I haven't heard anything.

GEORGE: Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)

JERRY: Really...

GEORGE: Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure...

JERRY: Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.

GEORGE: No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Ehh, You could get in trouble.

JERRY: Look, I gotta try and help the guy.

GEORGE: Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?

JERRY: Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...

GEORGE: W-What? What?

JERRY: Oh, that's *fantastic*!

GEORGE: He didn't get better, did he?

JERRY: Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!

GEORGE: Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
 
 

[Exterior of the Hospital then into Roy's room.  Roy is recovering with a huge plate of spaghetti.  Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George are visiting]

ROY: You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me.

GEORGE: Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great.  Hm hm mm.

KRAMER: Y'know, art's a great investment.

ELAINE: And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.

GEORGE: Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.

ROY: Hey, George...

GEORGE: Yeah.

(Roy puts his hand out -- George takes it, but Roy pulls him in and kisses him on the cheek.  George is a bit surprised but does not let on -- he claps his other hand to Roy's)

KRAMER: Awe, alright

JERRY: That's nice.

GEORGE: Thanks Roy.

[George leaves as the Doctor enters the room]

ROY: Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.)

DOCTOR: Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.

JERRY: What do you mean?

DOCTOR: I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...

(Kramer reaches into his shirt pocket and takes out a box of Junior mints -- he rattles it.)

KRAMER:  Mint?

DOCTOR: Those can be very refreshing.

(Kramer shakes a couple of mints from the box into the doctor's hand. The doctor turns and exits.)
 
(Roy is thinking about Elaine while continuing to eating the giant plate of spaghetti like an absolute pig.)

ROY: So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti)

ELAINE: Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)

JERRY: I don't think so...

ELAINE: We are... that means that we ah, we are...

JERRY: I believe we're not...

ELAINE: (Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?

JERRY: Well, I'll think about it...

 

[Exterior of Jerry's apartment building then inside where Jerry and the woman are talking...]

WOMAN: Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.

JERRY: Really...

WOMAN: Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.

JERRY: Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?

WOMAN: Yeah.

JERRY: Do you have it with you?

WOMAN: Yeah, it's in my purse.

JERRY: Ah, Le'me see.  (hands Jerry the playbill)

WOMAN: Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick  kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)

WOMAN: Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...

WOMAN: I had it autographed for my uncle.

JERRY: Yeah, I-I know...

WOMAN: (licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?

JERRY: Yes I do.

WOMAN: What is it?

JERRY: It-it rhymes with a female body part.

WOMAN: What is it?

JERRY: Mulva...

(She turns and grabs her purse, playbill and coat and leaves the apartment. Jerry follows)

JERRY: Aub, ah, Gipple?

(He stands in the open doorway and tries again)

JERRY: Loleola?

(Nope, obviously not. He closes the door and and goes to get something out of the refrigerator, but before the fridge light can even go on, a light goes on in Jerry's head and he rushes to the window to catch the Mystery Woman before she gets out of earshot.)

JERRY: Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
 

[Closing monologue.]

JERRY: Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''.  And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
 
 JERRY: ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something: if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.

 
[We open in front of a restaurant ("Kady's") with Jerry and Elaine waiting for the valet to come and get the keys for Jerry's car. Jerry is amusing himself by trying to drive Elaine nuts by humming and waving his scarf in front of her face.]

JERRY: Is that bothering you?

ELAINE: No, not at all...

(Amazing resilience, that Elaine has. The valet comes and Jerry gives him the keys. Elaine has some advice.)

ELAINE: Oh, could you please hurry?

JERRY: [mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.

ELAINE: What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...

JERRY: Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?

ELAINE: I don't want to keep him waiting...

JERRY: He'll like you more...

ELAINE: That's impossible...

(I'll buy that... Anyhoots, an elder married couple saunter by (yes, they actually saunter)...

WIFE: Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?

HUSBAND: Leave me alone.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...

JERRY: So, where am I dropping you?

ELAINE: His place...

JERRY: This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...

ELAINE: *And* he gets the rest of my chicken...

(No, that's no cleverly hidden euphemism. Elaine has a doggie bag from the restaurant.)

JERRY: So, is tonight "the night"?

ELAINE: You never know...

JERRY: Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!

(The car arrives. They drive away. Soon, they discover something is definitely amiss)

JERRY: Boy, do you smell something?

ELAINE: Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.

JERRY: What is it?

ELAINE: I think it's B.O.!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.

JERRY: It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.

ELAINE: Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.

JERRY: But the whole car smells.

ELAINE: So?

JERRY: So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.

(They each do their best dog impression and stick their heads out the window while they're driving. They come back inside. They moan disgustedly and stick their heads out, again.)

(We shift to Carl's rather nifty place.)

ELAINE: I can't believe you ski!

CARL: I'm a great skier.

ELAINE: Yeah? What else?

CARL: Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...

ELAINE: [delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?

CARL: ...When I travel.

ELAINE: See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.

(Elaine! I can do those things! I can pillage! I can plunder! I can pillage *and* plunder! I can even divide and conquer in a search algorithm! Oh, never mind... They embrace and kiss, but Carl gets a couple o' whiffs of Elaine's hair, and, judging by the look on Carl's face, he's not smelling Aussie Scrunch Spray)


[We shift to Champagne video where George is returning a movie with Kramer.]

GEORGE: This'll only take a second.

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm going to poke around...

(George goes towards the counter, but he sees a couple of girls holding hands browsing for movies (beside of a cardboard display for "A Few Good Men"-- the irony, the irony...)

GEORGE: [to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...

(The couple turns around and one of the two is Susan, George's ex-girlfriend!)

GEORGE: [to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?

(George turns around so as not to be recognized, but I'm guessing his distinctive bald head gives him away)

SUSAN: George?

GEORGE: [to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!

SUSAN: Renting a video! What do you got there?

GEORGE: Oh, ... some stupid movie...

SUSAN: This is Mona.

(George methodically extends his hand for a shake, bit by bit)

GEORGE: Oh, hi...

MONA: Pleasure to meet you.

GEORGE: Yes. Well...

MONA: Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.

SUSAN: You okay?

GEORGE: Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.

SUSAN: And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.

GEORGE: Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?

SUSAN: I *know* who I'm talking to.

GEORGE: Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...

SUSAN: I liked women?

GEORGE: There you go.

GEORGE: So, uh, how long has this been going on?

SUSAN: Since you and I broke up.

GEORGE: Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?

SUSAN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.

(Meanwhile, Kramer is practicing his golf swing across from an amused Mona. They can be seen talking in the background as Susan inspects George's movie)

SUSAN: So, what have you got there?

GEORGE: Oh, I, uh--

SUSAN: Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''

GEORGE: It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.

SUSAN: Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?

GEORGE: No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...

CLERK: Next.

GEORGE: Oh, that's me.

SUSAN: Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.

GEORGE: Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.

CLERK: Uh, what are you returning?

GEORGE: [embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.

CLERK: Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...

CLERK: Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.

GEORGE: $3.49? It says $1.49.

CLERK: Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.

GEORGE: What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!

KRAMER: George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.

GEORGE: I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...

(Ah yes, memories of Kramer putting thoughts into Newmans mind while dealing with Ron (of Ron's Records). Anyway, we cut to the apartment where Jerry and Elaine are bundling old magazines... )

JERRY: So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...

ELAINE: Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.

JERRY: What about skunk?

ELAINE: I don't mind skunk.

JERRY: Horse manure?

ELAINE: I *loooove* horse manure.

JERRY: Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.

ELAINE: Absolutely.

ELAINE: Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?

JERRY: It means he's lying.

ELAINE: Wow...

JERRY: Why? Is that what he told you?

ELAINE: Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...

JERRY: No. Never.

ELAINE: Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.

JERRY: Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.

ELAINE: Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?

JERRY: Anything's *possible*...

(Kramer Enters)

JERRY: What's the matter with you?

KRAMER: Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...

JERRY: Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...

KRAMER: I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...

JERRY: I know the list...

KRAMER: What's that smell?

JERRY: What smell?

KRAMER: Ooooh... You stink.

JERRY: Whatd'ya mean I stink?

KRAMER: You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?

JERRY: I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!

ELAINE: So?

JERRY: Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!

ELAINE: If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!

(George buzzes)

KRAMER: What happened?

JERRY: What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.

 
[In the car]

GEORGE: What is that? B.O.?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: This is *unbelievable* B.O.

JERRY: I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.

GEORGE: So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?

JERRY: No, no. It's the valet guy.

GEORGE: No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.

JERRY: Oh... No, that's ridiculous.

GEORGE: What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?

JERRY: Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.

GEORGE: The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.

GEORGE: Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!

JERRY: There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...

GEORGE: Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.

JERRY: Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...

(At the restaurant, Jerry, refuses to have his car parked by the valet.)

JERRY: Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!

(Inside, he confronts a snooty restaurant type guy.)

RESTAURATEUR: What do you mean-- "stunk up"?

JERRY: I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?

GEORGE: Stinks.

JERRY: Stinks!

RESTAURATEUR: Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour...

JERRY: Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!

RESTAURATEUR: Really? Well, I smell you now.

JERRY: That's from the car!

RESTAURATEUR: Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!

GEORGE: Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...

JERRY: Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.

RESTAURATEUR: I don't have time to smell cars.

GEORGE: Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...

JERRY: You've gotta smell the car

RESTAURATEUR: I'm a busy man

JERRY: C'mon! One whiff!

RESTAURATEUR: Alright, one whiff...

(Inside the car, the restaurateur realizes there is some reality in Jerry's story)

RESTAURATEUR: Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!

JERRY: Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?

RESTAURATEUR: Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!

(Jerry keeps him inside until he agrees to pay half ($125). To his horror, George discovers that some sick individual has stolen ``Rochelle, Rochelle'' from the dash of the car while they were inside. He asks the restaurateur to pay for that, too)

RESTAURATEUR: I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] "...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...


[Elaine and Carl at Elaine's apartment]

CARL: The valet had such bad B.O.?

ELAINE: Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...

CARL: That's a relief...

(Carl recoils from an embrace from Elaine)

ELAINE: What?

CARL: It's still there...

ELAINE: No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!

(Elaine corners the poor guy)


[We cut to the video store where George tells the clerk about the video. Susan shows up and George asks her]

GEORGE: Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.

CLERK: That'll be $98.00.

GEORGE: What $98.00?

CLERK: That's what I said. $98.00.

GEORGE: How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?

(He borrows $35 from Susan to pay for the movie)

GEORGE: So, was it me?

SUSAN: Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.

GEORGE: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.

SUSAN: Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.

GEORGE: Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?

SUSAN: You're an idiot.

GEORGE: Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.

SUSAN: I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.

GEORGE: It's not me! It's the car!

 
[Cut to Kramer waiting on a street corner]

MONA: I didn't think I'd come.

KRAMER: I knew you would.

MONA: Oh, Kramer!

(They embrace.)


[Car-wash]

CAR WASHER: We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.

JERRY: Let's do it.

 
[Cut to the hair salon where Elaine hears a similar tale from the hairdresser.]

HAIRDRESSER: The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.

ELAINE: Tomato Sauce?
 

[Jerry doles out his $250 and gets in the April-fresh car...]

JERRY: Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!


[Elaine visits Carl to present her olfactory-wise magnificent hair.]

CARL: It still smells.


[Jerry explains things to George back at the apartment.]

JERRY: It still smells!

GEORGE: How could it still smell after all that?

JERRY: I don't know!

GEORGE: Well, what are you gonna do?

JERRY: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!

GEORGE: You're *selling* the car!?

JERRY: You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.

GEORGE: Maybe I'll buy it.

JERRY: Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!

ELAINE: I still smell!

JERRY: You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!


[Outside, a woman's voice is heard screaming and pounding on Kramer's door.]

SUSAN: Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!

JERRY: Susan!

SUSAN: Kramer!

JERRY: What is going on?

SUSAN: You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.

GEORGE: He stole your girlfriend?

SUSAN: Yes. She's in *love* with him.

GEORGE: Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.

(Kramer waits until George and Susan have left, then calls Jerry on the phone, and begins to explain the situation to Jerry (while coming into his apartment, still on the phone). He realizes his silliness and puts the phone away, but continues the tale, explaining how Mona is a golf instructor, and how he's already taken six strokes off his game.)

JERRY: That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...

(Kramer explains further and borrows Jerry's jacket for his date with Mona that evening. As he's leaving, Elaine asks the inevitable)

ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--

KRAMER: I'm Kramer.

 
[George and Susan at Monk's]

GEORGE: I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?

SUSAN: I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.

GEORGE: Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...

SUSAN: You think so?

GEORGE: Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.

SUSAN: You're very sweet...

GEORGE: Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.

SUSAN: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah, you're just so... hip.

(A woman exits the bathroom and approached the table)

GEORGE: Oh, my God...

SUSAN: What?

GEORGE: It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.

(Despite his hiding, Allison sees George.)

ALLISON: George?

GEORGE: Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?

ALLISON: Good. You know, you owe me $50...

GEORGE: Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.

ALLISON: Nice to meet you...

SUSAN: Nice to meet you...

ALLISON: That's a beautiful vest...

SUSAN: Thank you...


[Kramer and Jerry at the car lot trying to sell J's car.]

KRAMER: I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.

SALESMAN: What year did you say this was?

JERRY: '90.

KRAMER: Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.

JERRY: That's strange...

SALESMAN: How many miles you got on this thing?

JERRY: 23 000.

KRAMER: And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...

JERRY: Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!

 
[Speak of the Devil, the car salesman exits the car with an "Augh!"... ]

SALESMAN: I can't sell this car.

JERRY: This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!


[At the salon, Elaine rationally decides her fate to the hairdresser]

HAIRDRESSER: So, what do you want to do?

ELAINE: Sauce me.


[In a rough-looking part of town]

(Jerry parks in front of a punk, tosses his keys in the car, and leaves, making it *very* obvious to the guy that the car has got a high steal quotient. He stops short of screaming "TAKE IT!". The punk gets in, and... well, let's just say he doesn't smell potpourri...)


[Opening Monologue] 

Why do we need B.O.? What is the function of it? Everything in nature has a reason, has a purpose, except B.O. Doesn't make any sense-- do something good, hard work, exercise, smell very bad. This is the way the human being is designed. You move, you stink. Why can't our bodies help us? Why can't sweat smell good? It'd be a different world, wouldn't it? Instead of putting your laundry in the hamper, you'd put it in a vase. You'd go down to the drugstore and pick up some odourant and perspirant. You'd probably have a dirty sweat sock hanging from the rear-view mirror of your car. And then on a really special night, maybe a little underwear comin' out of your breast pocket. Just to let her know she's important.

JERRY: I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!


[Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?

ELAINE: We don't walk that fast...

GEORGE: No seriously...

ELAINE: Seriously, we don't.

GEORGE: The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.

ELAINE: (Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!

JERRY (coming out of the bathroom) What's the big hurry?

ELAINE: Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?

JERRY: Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.

GEORGE: I gotta buy a present now?

ELAINE: Of course you do, it's an engagement party.

GEORGE: It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.

JERRY: You don't like the Drake?

GEORGE: Hate the Drake.

ELAINE: I *love* the Drake.

JERRY: How could you not like the Drake?

GEORGE: Who's the Drake?

ELAINE: "Who's the Drake"?

JERRY: The Drake is good!

ELAINE: So listen, what are you gonna get him?

GEORGE: I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)

JERRY: Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!

ELAINE: So what? That's easy.

JERRY: Easy?

(Kramer enters in his usual way)

ELAINE: Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?

KRAMER: Uh, no, no, not yet.

JERRY: Do you like the Drake?

KRAMER: I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!

ELAINE: I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.

KRAMER: (Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...

JERRY: It's Isosceles

KRAMER: Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.

ELAINE: Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.

JERRY: The chip-in!

ELAINE: Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?

JERRY: Yeah!

KRAMER: Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!

JERRY: You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.

KRAMER: No, no! My car's not running.

(George enters the room from the washroom)

JERRY: What about your father's car?

GEORGE: No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.

JERRY: Are you serious?

GEORGE: You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.

JERRY: How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!

GEORGE: Good thinking!

JERRY: Good to meet you!


[George's father's car]

ELAINE: So what are we gonna get him?

JERRY: We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.

GEORGE: I like this area. I could live out here.

KRAMER: Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.

JERRY: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.

GEORGE: Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?

MAN IN CAR: No!

KRAMER: Why don't you take a handicap spot...

GEORGE: You think?

ELAINE: No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.

GEORGE: I don't want to walk that far.

ELAINE: What if a handicapped person needs it?

KRAMER: Oh, come on, they don't drive!

JERRY: Yes, they do!

KRAMER: Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?

JERRY: Well there's spaces there, they must drive!

KRAMER: Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.

ELAINE: So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?

GEORGE: Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!

KRAMER: I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.

GEORGE: He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?

ELAINE: What does that mean?

GEORGE: Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.

KRAMER: Yeah, go ahead.

ELAINE: George!

GEORGE: Oh, come on, it's five minutes.

(pulls into handicap spot)

KRAMER: Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.

JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE: Don't worry. We won't forget!


[walking in the parking garage]

JERRY: Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?

ELAINE: What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...

GEORGE: What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...

JERRY: No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!

ELAINE: Got to *love* the Drake!

(sound of police cars)

JERRY: Hey, what's going on over here?

ELAINE: Must have been an accident...

(they turn the corner so they can see their car, surrounded by a lot of people)

JERRY: (to a woman) Hey, what's going on?

WOMAN: Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...

JERRY: Is she OK?

WOMAN: I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!

JERRY: Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.

(man hits George's car in rage)

GEORGE: How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!

ELAINE: (to George) Are you happy now?

KRAMER: Who would think these people we're gonna be here?

JERRY: I don't know...

ELAINE: What about the party? What about the Drake?

GEORGE: Screw the Drake!

JERRY: I love the Drake!

KRAMER: Let's just take a bus back to the city.

GEORGE: Can't leave the car here!

KRAMER: Why not?

GEORGE: It's my father's car!

MAN: Let's smash it!

EVERYBODY: Yeah! Yeah!

JERRY: Let's get out of here.


[coffee shop]

GEORGE: What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?

JERRY: The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?

ELAINE: Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?

JERRY: What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...

GEORGE: What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!

KRAMER: You'd think...

GEORGE: I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?

KRAMER: Most of them don't even have batteries.

GEORGE: Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.

KRAMER: Yeah...

GEORGE: Well, I'm sorry!

ELAINE: Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...

GEORGE: How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!

JERRY: I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.

ELAINE: Me?

JERRY: Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!

ELAINE: Oh, they won't?

JERRY: Not if they don't know you...

ELAINE: I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!

KRAMER: No chance in hell!

JERRY: What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming: "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!

GEORGE: That's good, we'll give it a try...

ELAINE: That's good...

JERRY: That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!

KRAMER: Huh?


[parking garage]

(the four of them approach George's car, which is smashed to pieces)

JERRY: (as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...


[George's parents' house]

FRANK: Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!

(Estelle is playing Mahjongh with the ladies)

FRANK: A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!

GEORGE: Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!

ESTELLE: (to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!

FRANK: (to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!

MAHJONG LADY: Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!

FRANK: No it isn't!

MAHJONG LADY: So what are you doing now, Georgie?

GEORGE: I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...

FRANK: Where the hell is my paper?

MAHJONG LADY: You're writing a pilot?

ESTELLE: With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...

MAHJONG LADY: So what's it about?

GEORGE: Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
sentences him to be Jerry's butler.

MAHJONG LADY: This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!
(giggling)

ESTELLE: Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!

GEORGE: Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...

ESTELLE: He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...

(Estelle wins at Mahjongh)


[Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's on the phone with the Drake, Elaine is eating an Oreo cookie)

JERRY: (to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!

ELAINE: Oh, yeah...

JERRY: (to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?

ELAINE: Sure!

JERRY: (to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...

JERRY: The Drake is great!

ELAINE: Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.

JERRY: Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.

(buzzer rings)

JERRY: Yes?

GEORGE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Door opens, Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.

JERRY: St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?

KRAMER: Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.

ELAINE: You went to see her?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Wow, what happened?

KRAMER: I'm in love.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.

JERRY: Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.

(George enters)

KRAMER: Ah, I'm glad you're here.

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.

GEORGE: A wheelchair? What for?

KRAMER: Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!

GEORGE: Doesn't she have collision?

KRAMER: George, I'm in love with her!

GEORGE: Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.

KRAMER: No! She needs it now!

GEORGE: What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?

KRAMER: Well...

ELAINE: Hey, we told you not to park there!

GEORGE: Can't we just fix the old one?

KRAMER: Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?

GEORGE: Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!


[at Surgical Appliances]

SALESMAN: This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.

KRAMER: So now, what's this got?

SALESMAN: Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.

GEORGE: How much?

SALESMAN: 6200.

GEORGE: Do you have something a little more... less expensive?


[At the Drake's]

(The Drake opens the door, the Drakette is sitting on the couch)

JERRY and ELAINE: Hey Drake! Hi Drake!

JERRY:Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!

ELAINE: My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?

THE DRAKE: Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...

(Jerry sits down next to Alison)

JERRY: I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....

ELAINE: Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?

JERRY: So where're we eatin'?

THE DRAKE: Well, actually... Jerry...

ELAINE: I'm *really* hungry!

THE DRAKE: ... we just broke up...

JERRY: When did this happen?

THE DRAKE: About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!

JERRY: (looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...

ELAINE: Oh, cristal clear!

JERRY: They know how to make 'em...

(The Drake starts sobbing)

ELAINE: Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?

THE DRAKE: (through his sobbing) Gagliano's... that's pretty good...

JERRY: Well... we should...

ELAINE: Get movin'...

JERRY: Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.

ELAINE: Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!

(The Drake is sobbing again, Elaine takes the remote control out the door then returns)

ELAINE: Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...


[at Surgical Appliances]

SALESMAN: Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.

KRAMER: But this'll get you around?

SALESMAN: Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.

GEORGE: Like what?

SALESMAN: For example, your tremor-damping.

KRAMER: Now what's that?

SALESMAN: It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.

KRAMER: Well, is it alright if I try it?

SALESMAN: Hop in!

(Kramer sits down, and likes it)

KRAMER: Oh yeah!

(Salesman is laughing)

SALESMAN: I tell ya...

(Kramer crashes into wheelchairs while trying to control his)

SALESMAN: When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.

GEORGE: How much?

(Kramer crashes into some more wheelchairs)

SALESMAN: How about $240?

GEORGE & KRAMER: We'll take it!


[Jerry's appartment]

ELAINE: Drake gave her the TV?

JERRY: He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.

ELAINE: Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!

JERRY: I know it is!

ELAINE: Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!

JERRY: I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.

ELAINE: They don't know anybody in Chicago.

JERRY: Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.

(George enters)

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.

GEORGE (excited) The Drake broke up?! That's fantastic! Now we get the TV back! It'll help defray some of the cost of the wheelchair.

JERRY: I don't know about defraying.

GEORGE: Why?

JERRY: We're not gettin' that TV.

GEORGE: What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.

ELAINE: The Drakette took it.

GEORGE: She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.

ELAINE: Well, she has it!

GEORGE: (upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!

GEORGE: Maybe we should call her.

ELAINE: Well, who's gonna call?

JERRY: You are.

ELAINE: What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?

JERRY: Because that's your thing!

ELAINE: What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?

JERRY: Yeah, that's your thing.

ELAINE: Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...

(Elaine starts dialling)

JERRY: (to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: I could see that...

(Alison through phone): Hello?

ELAINE: Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...

(Alison through phone): I gave all the gifts to charity.

ELAINE: Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...

(Alison though phone): I hate the Drake.

ELAINE: Everybody does. Bye-bye....

(Elaine hangs up the phone)

ELAINE: She gave it to charity.

JERRY: Charity?!? That's apalling.

GEORGE: How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!

GEORGE: You mean a blessing in disguise?

KRAMER: Yeah....


[At George's parents' place]

LADY: And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!

(applause)

LADY: Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!

(applause, door bel rings)

LADY: On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!

(Estelle opens the front door, two men walk in)

FRANK: Well... thank you very much!

COP: Mr. Costanza?

FRANK: Yes?

COP: You're under arrest.

FRANK: Under arrest? What for?

COP: Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.

FRANK: What's that?

COP: Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...

FRANK: George! George!


[Jerry's appartment]

JERRY: Your father got arrested? For what?

GEORGE: Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.

JERRY: Ho-ly!

GEORGE: Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...

JERRY: So what are you gonna do?

GEORGE: I agreed to become his butler.

JERRY: What?

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: What's the matter?

KRAMER: It's over!

JERRY: What's over?

KRAMER: Me and Lola....

GEORGE: The woman we bought the wheelchair for?

KRAMER: Yeah, she dumped me!

JERRY: She dumped you?

KRAMER: She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?

JERRY & GEORGE: (hesitatingly) ... no...

KRAMER: Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?

GEORGE: ...you're very attractive...

KRAMER: yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!

JERRY: Drop dead?

GEORGE: Boy, even I never heard that one...

JERRY: She's pretty rough!

KRAMER: Yeesh-jip!

GEORGE: Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.

JERRY: 240 bucks?

GEORGE: Well, it was slightly used...

JERRY: Used?


[cut to Lola rolling down a hill trying to use her brakes that don't work, screaming]


[George's parents' place]

(George's vaccuuming)

Frank (picking up his shoes): I don't think you did such a good job on these...

(George turns off the vaccuum)

GEORGE: What!?

FRANK: You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?

(Phone rings)

FRANK: Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!

(hangs up the phone)

FRANK: George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.

GEORGE: Sons of bitches!

FRANK: Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.

GEORGE: Big screen TV?

FRANK: Do you think you can handle it?


[At the Drakette's]

(knock on door, the Drakette opens)

ALLISON: Yes?

GEORGE: Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.

ALLISON: Oh great, it's right over there.

KRAMER: Ooh, it's a big one!


[All four inside a delivery van outside the mall]

GEORGE: Who's got the receipt?

ELAINE: I do.

GEORGE: Will they give us cash?

JERRY: That's their policy.

GEORGE: I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...

KRAMER: Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?

GEORGE: What if there is a fire?

KRAMER: What are the chances of that?

JERRY: To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.


[setting: Jerry's]

(Jerry is entering his apartment, following by Kramer)

KRAMER: Why can't I play Kramer?

JERRY: Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!

KRAMER: Neither are you.

JERRY: I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.

JERRY: My grandmother's in the hospital.

KRAMER: Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!

JERRY: This is real believable.

KRAMER: What you didn't think I was really laughing?

JERRY: It stinks.

KRAMER: Let me see you do it.

JERRY: Say something funny.

KRAMER: Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.

JERRY: Ah..........

KRAMER: Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)

(George enters while they're both laughing)

GEORGE: Why are two pretending to be laughing?

JERRY: We're acting. (they stop laughing)

GEORGE: Oh, real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.

JERRY: (to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.

KRAMER: (to George) Yeah!

GEORGE: Out of the question.

KRAMER: Oughh!

GEORGE: (to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesn't know)

(scene ends)


[setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant]

(Elaine and Russell are sitting down at a table)

RUSSELL: I really appreciate you coming.

ELAINE: Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...

RUSSELL: All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...

ELAINE: That was two months ago.

RUSSELL: Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)

ELAINE: Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)

RUSSELL: But I want you.

ELAINE: God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).

RUSSELL: Is it something I said... or did?

ELAINE: Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.

RUSSELL: Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.

RUSSELL: Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.

ELAINE: Really? What is it about?

RUSSELL: (a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.

ELAINE: (surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?

RUSSELL: (starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?

ELAINE: Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.

RUSSELL: There's a show. that's a show.

ELAINE: Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...

RUSSELL: (stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.

ELAINE: I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).

(scene ends)


[setting: Jerry's]

(back to when we left earlier with Jerry, Kramer and George. Jerry is answering the phone while Kramer is about to go back into his apartment)

JERRY: Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.

GEORGE: He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)

(Kramer sits down and starts to talk on the phone)

JERRY: (to George) Again with the sweat pants?

GEORGE: What? I'm comfortable.

JERRY: You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)

KRAMER: (to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Who is it?

KRAMER: That's NBC.

JERRY: NBC!?! Give me the phone!

KRAMER: I'm in the middle of a conversation here.

JERRY: Get off the phone!

KRAMER: (to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)

JERRY: You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?

KRAMER: Russell Dalrimple's secretary.

JERRY: All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)

(scene ends)

 
[setting: Dana's office]

GEORGE: What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?

DANA: That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.

DANA: I thought you didn't believe in God?

GEORGE: I do for the bad things.

DANA: Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?

GEORGE: What?

DANA: It's like a discoloration. It's white.

GEORGE: (gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.

DANA: You'd better get that checked out.

GEORGE: Better get that checked out?

DANA: I would.

GEORGE: What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?

DANA: I'm trying to help you.

GEORGE: What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)

DANA: I think you'd better go.

GEORGE: Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)

(scene ends)

 
[setting: Jerry and George in a cab at a light]

JERRY: Where?

GEORGE: Right here. (showing his lip)

JERRY: Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')

GEORGE: (to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?

CABBIE: Yeah, it's like a discoloration.

GEORGE: Oh, my God.

CABBIE: Yeah, it's all white.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!

JERRY: Would you stop?

CABBIE: I would get that checked out if I were you.

GEORGE: Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.

JERRY: If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.

GEORGE: Catch what in time?

JERRY: Whatever it is.

GEORGE: You think it's something?

CABBIE: Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers)

JERRY: (to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.

JOE DEVOLA: (through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away)

(scene ends)


[setting: NBC]

(Stu and Jay are sitting. George is standing in front of them, asking about his lip. The Casting Director, a woman, is sitting across from them on a couch. Jerry is in the back, standing and looking through the window. There's a box of raisins on the coffee table.)

STU: (to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.

GEORGE: (to Jay) What do you think it is?

JAY: It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers)

CASTING DIRECTOR: O.K. guys, are we ready to start?

JERRY: Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.

(George sits down next to Stu and Jay, and grabs a magazine and the box of raisins. Jerry walks over to Goerge and sits next to him.)

STU: Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.

JAY: He must be worried about the fall schedule.

STU: Ah, it's a real bear.

GEORGE: Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?

STU: Yeah. Right.

(the casting director enters with an actor)

CASTING DIRECTOR: This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)

MARK: Hey how you doing?

JERRY: (thinking) They've gotta be kidding.

GEORGE: (thinking) This guy's perfect.

CASTING DIRECTOR: O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.

MARK: Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)

CASTING DIRECTOR: No. Why?

MARK: Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: "Vandelay Industries".

CASTING DIRECTOR: I'm Vandelay Industries?

MARK: Right.

CASTING DIRECTOR: What is that?

MARK: You're in latex.

CASTING DIRECTOR: What do I do with latex?

MARK: I don't know, you manufacture it.

(scene cuts)

(the casting director enters with another actor)

CASTING DIRECTOR: This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses)

ALL: Hi Michael. How you doing?

JERRY: Everything all right?

MICHAEL: I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)

CASTING DIRECTOR: Any questions?

MICHAEL: Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?

GEORGE: No, not a loser!

CASTING DIRECTOR: Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?

MICHAEL: A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)

CASTING DIRECTOR: So?

MICHAEL: Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...

CASTING DIRECTOR: He was what?

MICHAEL: He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)

CASTING DIRECTOR: That's a massage.

MICHAEL: I think it moved.

(scene cuts)

(the casting director enters with a beautiful actress)

CASTING DIRECTOR: This is Melissa Shannon.

MELISSA: Hi.

ALL: Hi. How you doing.

CASTING DIRECTOR: Melissa is reading for Elaine.

MELISSA: It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.

JERRY: No you didn't. He knows he's bald.

MELISSA: So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)

CASTING DIRECTOR: O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)

JERRY: (getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.

MELISSA: Oh, great.

(the casting director leaves the chair to Jerry. Jerry sits in front of Melissa and slides the chair very close to her)

JERRY: Alright, want to start?

MELISSA: Yeah.

JERRY: O.K.

MELISSA: Ahem. What was that look?

JERRY: What look?

MELISSA: That look you just gave me?

JERRY: I gave a look?

MELISSA: Yes.

GEORGE: Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)

CASTING DIRECTOR: Let's see some more Kramers.

(We see many short scenes with a wide variety of fat, tall, or small actors opening the door like Kramer does. Finally enters Tom Pepper, the guy that will get the role o Kramer)

ALL: Hi. How you doing?

TOM: (to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?

JERRY: (smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.

(scene cuts)

(Tom and the casting director are into a scene)

CASTING DIRECTOR: What is this about?

TOM: (standing) Levels.

CASTING DIRECTOR: Levels?

TOM: Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt.

CASTING DIRECTOR: I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?

TOM: Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)

GEORGE: Very nice

JERRY: Very good

GEORGE: Very nice Tom, that was terrific.

TOM: May I? (pointing the box of raisins)

GEORGE: Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)

JERRY: (to George) It was a wonderful reading.

GEORGE: Yeah. Really.

TOM: Well, bye.

GEORGE: Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)

STU: Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.

JERRY: Yeah, I liked him.

GEORGE: What happened to the raisins?

JAY: Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!

GEORGE: Did he just steal the raisins?

STU: You think he stole them?

CASTING DIRECTOR: (enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.

JERRY: (to Kramer) What are you doing here?

CASTING DIRECTOR: You two know each other?

STU: Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.

KRAMER: That's true.

(Jerry and George look at each other. They're gonna let Kramer have a shot at it. Kramer unfold the script and smile at Jerry and George, very confident.)

KRAMER: (acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?

STU: I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.

KRAMER: Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)

(We see Kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall, and opening the bathroom's door. Someone in there says: "Sorry buddy, full house." We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant: "Sorry, customers only" ...running into a movie theater: "Hey you need a ticket!" ...running through the park...)

(scene ends)
 

[setting: Monk's]

(Jerry and Elaine at a booth)

ELAINE: So who's playing Elaine?

JERRY: Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Who is it?

JERRY: She's an eskimo, actually.

ELAINE: Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)

JERRY: She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.

ELAINE: Listen, was Russell at the casting?

JERRY: No, he didn't show up.

ELAINE: You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?

JERRY: No. No you're not.

ELAINE: Why do I keep setting you up?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: (to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.

JERRY: Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?

ELAINE: Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.

JERRY: Beside that. Look at the waitresses.

ELAINE: Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)

JERRY: What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?

ELAINE: Ah...

JERRY: I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?

ELAINE: Yes, I would say.

JERRY: What's going on here. How is that possible?

ELAINE: Do you think it's a coincidence?

JERRY: No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.

(the waitress finally came with the coffee)

ELAINE: (to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?

WAITRESS: He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)

ELAINE: You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?

JERRY: Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.

(scene ends)

 
[setting: doctor's clinic]

GEORGE: You see, It's right here. It's all white...

DOCTOR: Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.

GEORGE: You've never seen this before?

DOCTOR: I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)

GEORGE: (dramatically) A what?

DOCTOR: A biopsy.

GEORGE: A biopsy?

DOCTOR: Yeah.

GEORGE: Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?

DOCTOR: Well I don't know what it is.

(scene ends)

 
[setting: Jerry's]

GEORGE: A biopsy!

JERRY: What did he say?

GEORGE: He said he didn't know what it was.

JERRY: Alright. So?

GEORGE: When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear: "Cancer? Get outta here?"

JERRY: Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.

GEORGE: How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school: "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)

JERRY: Can't you at least die with a little dignity?

GEORGE: No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: Hey. What happened to you yesterday?

KRAMER: I got mugged.

GEORGE: You got mugged?

JERRY: Mugged?

KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.

JERRY: Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?

KRAMER: It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...

(door buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: But now I have a big problem, buddy.

JERRY: What is it?

KRAMER: Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.

JERRY: You didn't go?

KRAMER: No. And now I can't get it back.

(George gives back the sandwich to Jerry and goes to the bathroom)

JERRY: The % thing to do is just not think about it.

KRAMER: How could you not think about it?

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Hey.

KRAMER: (mumbles and leaves)

ELAINE: What's the matter with him?

JERRY: He's a little backed up.

ELAINE: Oh...

(George gets back from the bathroom and takes back the sandwich from Jerry's hand and sit on the couch.)

GEORGE: Elaine.

ELAINE: So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.

JERRY: Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)

(Elaine goes into Jerry' bedroom)

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.

ELAINE: So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.

GEORGE: Apply for a job? What for?

ELAINE: Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)

GEORGE: It's a coincidence.

JERRY: This is what you gonna wear?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: You're not gonna get the job.

ELAINE: Exactly.

(phone rings, Jerry gets up and answers, Elaine sits on the couch's arm next to George and takes a bite of his sandwich)

JERRY: (to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)

ELAINE: Who was it?

JERRY: TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.

ELAINE: What about the dogs?

JERRY: They're having sex in the hotel room.

(scene ends)

 
[setting: Peter McManus cafe, same table as earlier]

(Jerry and TV Elaine: Sandi Robbins)

SANDI: So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.

JERRY: Yes.

SANDI: And she's really your ex-girlfriend?

JERRY: Uh, Huh, yeah.

SANDI: I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.

JERRY: Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.

SANDI: How would she eat a hamburger?

JERRY: With her hands.

SANDI: What about pasta?

JERRY: Also with her hands.

SANDI: Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.

JERRY: Everything?

SANDI: Everything.

JERRY: All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.

SANDI: That's good. What's her favorite movie?

JERRY: Shaft.

SANDI: You got to get me a picture. What about sex?

JERRY: She likes talking during sex.

SANDI: Oh... dirty talking?

JERRY: No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)

SANDI: Elaine.

JERRY: What?

SANDI: Call me Elaine.

JERRY: All right. Elaine.

SANDI: How does Elaine kiss?

JERRY: Well--

SANDI: Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry)

JERRY: Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--

SANDI: Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral)

JERRY: I think you got it.

(scene ends)


[setting: Monk's]

(Kramer and Tom at a the booth behind the cashier)

KRAMER: I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.

TOM: I'll have a hamburger. That's it.

KRAMER: Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.

TOM: This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.

KRAMER: You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.

TOM: I'm Kramer.

KRAMER: Whoa, I'm Kramer.

(scene cuts to Elaine who enters and walks to the manager)

Mr. VISAKI: (foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table.

ELAINE: No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.

Mr. VISAKI: (looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before.

ELAINE: Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.

Mr. VISAKI: I don't think I need anyone else right now.

ELAINE: You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)

Mr. VISAKI: What? What did I do?

(scene ends)

 

[setting: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office]

ELAINE: Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.

FRED: Who's Russ Meyer?

ELAINE: Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.

FRED: Anyway, go on.

ELAINE: Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.

FRED: (to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.

PAUL: (to Elaine) Hi.

ELAINE: Hi.

FRED: Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.

PAUL: (to Elaine) Really?

[setting: NBC, pilot's set]

(Jerry, Tom, and Michael are at the counter, rehearsing. George is standing and watching them next to another guy. Rita, Jay, Stu and Russell are sitting in the crowd's bleachers)

TOM: What do you mean made up?

JERRY: It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.

TOM: You're crazy.

JERRY: No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?

MICHAEL: What do you mean Danish?

GEORGE: (to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)

JERRY: Danish. Is it from Denmark?

MICHAEL: No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.

TOM: I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.

RITA: (to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly)

GEORGE: Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling: "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?

TOM: I'm not gonna say it like that.

GEORGE: Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)

YELLING GUY: (with the same bothered face and while he's looking at George) All right everybody, take a five.

GEORGE: (very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!

JERRY: George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.

GEORGE: Why is that?

JERRY: I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?

GEORGE: Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?

JERRY: Why would he steal a box of raisins?

GEORGE: Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)

(scene cuts to the bleachers with the producers)

RITA: (to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?

RUSSELL: What?

RITA: You O.K.?

RUSSELL: Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)

(scene cuts to Jerry sitting next to Sandi. They're both going through their copy of the script)

SANDI: What's the matter?

JERRY: Nothing.

SANDI: You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?

JERRY: No.

SANDI: Are you breaking up with me?

JERRY: Are we going out?

SANDI: You're breaking up with me, aren't you? (almost crying)

JERRY: Do you want me to break up with you?

SANDI: If that's what you want.

JERRY: I don't even know what you're talking about.

SANDI: Fine. Break up with me.

JERRY: All right. We're broken up.

SANDI: (little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what's going on)

(scene cuts to George and Tom standing, backstage)

GEORGE: Remember when you came to audition for us?

TOM: Yeah.

GEORGE: There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?

TOM: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.

TOM: Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?

GEORGE: Oh, no, no--

TOM: (angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!?

GEORGE: No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)

TOM: Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?

GEORGE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.

(scene cuts to Russell, still on the set, but on the phone with Elaine)

RUSSELL: (nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)

DAVID: Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.

RUSSELL: All right. All right. What's your name?

DAVID: David Richardson.

RUSSELL: Get out! You're fired!

DAVID: But Mr. Dalrimple--

RUSSELL: Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)

(scene ends)

 
[setting: Jerry's]

GEORGE: The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.

JERRY: Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

JERRY: Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!

GEORGE: Come on you're... uh... you're fine.

JERRY: This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.

GEORGE: What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.

JERRY: This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.

GEORGE: The guy playing Kramer threatened me.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: 'cause I asked him about the raisins.

JERRY: You mentioned the raisins.

GEORGE: Oh yeah.

JERRY: Did he take 'em?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?

GEORGE: That's what I'm trying to find out.

(Kramer enters slowly and carefully)

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Any luck?

KRAMER: No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.

JERRY: What about bran?

KRAMER: I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.

JERRY: Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.

KRAMER: Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.

JERRY: Oh, it's not that bad!

GEORGE: Yes it is.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.

JERRY: (to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?

ELAINE: No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.

JERRY: Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.

ELAINE: Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.

JERRY: We need you there!

ELAINE: (to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?

KRAMER: No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)

(scene ends)

 
[setting: NBC, pilot's set, the taping]

The taping is about to begin.

People are walking into the studio.

Jerry is getting a makeup.

Michael walks around backstage, he seems nervous and agitated.

Rita, Stu and Jay are sitting in the crowd. Russell is missing.

George looks at his lip in a mirror.

Tom is sitting in his dressing room, eating the raisins.

Elaine walks into the studio, wearing and adjusting a blonde short-haired wig, and also wearing bold glsasses.

Scene cuts to the drugstore where Kramer is buying the dreaded apparatus.

Sandi, sitting next to Jerry who's still getting a makeup, is having her hair done.

SANDI: (to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!

ASSISTANT DRESSER: Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?

JERRY: Try Elaine.

ASSISTANT DRESSER: Elaine?

SANDI: Yes?

(scene cuts to the crowd. Elaine is sitting in the front with her disguise, and a guy behind her taps on her shoulder)

WILTON: Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?

ELAINE: Oh, right.

WILTON: Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.

(scene cuts to Michael, backstage, still walking around nervously. He sees Jerry andruns to him)

MICHAEL: I can't remember my lines!!!

JERRY: Just relax, you'll be fine.

MICHAEL: I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!

JERRY: You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!

MICHAEL: Help me Jerry! Help me!

(scene cuts to the producers in the crowd)

RITA: (to Stu) Where is Russell?

STU: You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.

JAY: He hasn't been well.

STU: (to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.

RITA: How pathetic.

(scene cuts to George on the same phone as Russell earlier)

GEORGE: This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)

(scene cuts to the crowd and we see Joe Devola is there)

(scene cuts to Kramer entering his apartment with the dreaded apparatus)

(scene cuts to George, happy, eating and double-dipping chips. Tom is staring at him, George notices him, and aborts a double-dip)

GEORGE: (he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.

TOM: How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?

(scene cuts to the presentor, Pat Hazell, talking to the crowd)

PAT HAZELL: Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right.

(scene cuts to Kramer holding and staring at the dreaded apparatus, then closing his bathroom's door.)

(scene cuts to Jerry, holding a microphone and talking to the crowd)

JERRY: Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--

JOE DEVOLA: (getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)

(scene ends)


[setting: Jerry's]

GEORGE: Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?

JERRY: Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.

GEORGE: Really? What does it mean?

JERRY: It means: "Death to tyrants".

GEORGE: I can see that.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?

JERRY: No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?

ELAINE: Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.

GEORGE: Yeah, me too.

JERRY: Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...

(Kramer enters, singing and dancing)

KRAMER: Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!

JERRY: Well, well, well.

ELAINE: Congratulations.

KRAMER: Well, thank you.

GEORGE: You went for the big "E".

KRAMER: Wet and wild.

JERRY: All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.

KRAMER: Oh, yes.

(Elaine finds something under the couch cushions)

ELAINE: Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.

JERRY: A wallet? Let me see that.

ELAINE: Here.

JERRY: Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.

GEORGE: Shh! This is it!

JERRY: How do you like that?

 

(The show begins. There are three different settings while the show is on TV. Each line or description will be preceded by the right setting:

[Jerry's] Jerry's apartment with Elaine, George and Kramer watching the pilot.

[TV] The pilot

[Viewers] Characters from the season 4, watching TV in their home and commenting on the pilot.)

===[TV]===

(Jerry's doing his stand-up routine at a comedy club. There's the music theme and we don't hear what he is saying, but the closed captions put that:

"I get into a car accident. The guy that hit me doesn't have any insurance. So the judge sentences him to be my butler. Sounds like a sitcom, doesn't it?"

We see the title 'Jerry', then, sitting at the comedy club, we see:

Micheal, Sandi, and Tom, and finally Jerry, and the four of them make a toast while it's written: "Created by Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza".

===[Jerry's]===

(they all applause as the intro ends)

ELAINE: Bravo!

(Kramer taps George on the shoulder)

GEORGE: You hurt me.

===[TV]===

(Jerry's apartment, Michael knocks and enters)

MICHAEL: Hey.

JERRY: Hey George.

MICHAEL: New sneakers?

JERRY: Yeah.

MICHAEL: What do you need new sneakers for?

JERRY: I like sneakers.

MICHAEL: How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.

JERRY: Nah, you're crazy anyway.

CHARLES: (to himself, upset) Start in the bedroom...

(Tom enters)

TOM: Hey.

JERRY: Hey. The butler's here.

TOM: He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house.

JERRY: I'm not sending him to your house.

TOM: Why not?

JERRY: Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.

TOM: Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.

JERRY: But I don't want to.

KRAMER: Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.

JERRY: Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?

(quick shot at ===[Jerry's]=== they all watch)

JERRY: You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".

(end of the pilot and of the three different settings)

JERRY: Oh, my God. Did he get fired?

RITA: To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.

JERRY: Russell's disappeared?

RITA: In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.

JERRY: You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!

RITA: Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry.

JERRY: Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)

(Jerry and George stare at Elaine)

ELAINE: What-- What are you looking at me for?

GEORGE: It was you!

ELAINE: What did I do?

JERRY: Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?

ELAINE: I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.

GEORGE: Yes it is! You're very charming!

ELAINE: I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?

What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?

FRED: Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.

PAUL: Yeah, we're checking it out.

ELAINE: (to Paul) You're checking it out?

(a man is leaving the restaurant and walks by Fred and Paul's table)

MAN: (to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.

Mr. VISAKI: Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows.

ELAINE: (to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!

(they all show smiles of surprise)

ELAINE: (embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.
