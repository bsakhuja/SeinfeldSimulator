[Scene: Comedy club]

JERRY: You know, why we're here? [he means: here in the "Comedy club"] To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. [imitates one of these people "tryin' to find us"; pretends his hand is a phone] "Did you ring?, I can't find him." [imitates other person on phone] "Where did he go?" [the first person again] "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be getting back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.
 
[Scene: Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.]
JERRY: Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. [talking about George's shirt] The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.
GEORGE: Are you through? [kind of irritated]
JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?
GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.
JERRY: Oh, you don't recall?
GEORGE: [pretends he's talking into a microphone] Uh, no, not at this time.
JERRY: Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. [a waitress approaches the table]
WAITRESS: Mister Seinfeld. [she pours coffee in his cup] Mister Costanza. [she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her]
GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?
WAITRESS: It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. [ironically]
JERRY: Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.
WAITRESS: Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. [she pours the coffee and walks away]
GEORGE: How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?
JERRY: Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.
GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
GEORGE: No, you didn't!
JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what...
GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table] what is she like?
JERRY: Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.
GEORGE: [with a big smile] So, ya know, what, what happened?
JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great.
GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: This is great!
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.
GEORGE: [whistles disapproving] Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?
JERRY: Yeah, but...
GEORGE: "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?
JERRY: Yeah!
GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.
JERRY: [indignant] What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!
GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?
JERRY: Yes!
GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!
JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
GEORGE: [The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?
CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?
GEORGE: Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.
JERRY: [to George] Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?
GEORGE: [to Claire] Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to [makes some gestures to accent "has to"] come to New York on business...
JERRY: Oh you are beautiful! [ironically]
GEORGE: and, and maybe [again some gestures] she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
CLAIRE: I'd have to say: uuhh, no. [George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO]
GEORGE: [to Claire] So why did she call?
CLAIRE: To be polite.
GEORGE: To be polite, I rest my case.
JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me [stands up], I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
GEORGE: I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
JERRY: Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".
GEORGE: Come on, I'm tired.
CLAIRE: [to Jerry] Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.
GEORGE: [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics] Right, I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile]
 
[Scene: Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers]
GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. [walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry]
JERRY: Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.
GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...
JERRY: And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
GEORGE: What?!
JERRY: Laura.
GEORGE: I can't believe: [falls on his knees] WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
GEORGE: [gets up] 'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: What is that? It's ridiculous! [Jerry bobs agreeingly] You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers again] Signal!
JERRY: Maybe you're right.
GEORGE: Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.
JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
GEORGE: [puts an arm around Jerry and whispers] I know, I know. [normal voice] Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?
JERRY: No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.
GEORGE: You're gonna "overdry" it.
JERRY: You, you can't "overdry".
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: Same as you can't "overwet". [George looks puzzled] You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".
GEORGE: [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?
JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? [George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid]
GEORGE: [points to the dryer] Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle! [Jerry looks surprised]
 
[Scene: Comedy club]
JERRY: "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: [shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid]...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: [sock's voice] "Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road [shows how the sock is going down the road]. They got buttons sowed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first.
 
[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV]
JERRY: [The phone rings. He picks it up and says:] If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no [somebody knocks at the door] Yeah? [to the door, while still at the phone]
KRAMER: [enters] Are you up?
JERRY: [To Kramer] Yeah...[in the phone] Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem [hangs up the phone].
KRAMER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
JERRY: [upset] Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! [actually I can't understand the name; maybe "Kramer" wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!] I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
KRAMER: Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...[takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets] You got any meat?
JERRY: [a little irritated] Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! [Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in] Well what, what happened in the game anyway?
KRAMER: [still with his head in the refrigerator] What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! [takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.
JERRY: [cynical] Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!
KRAMER: Yeah. [Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look" and Kramer asks:] Are you done with this?
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
KRAMER: I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
JERRY: No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.
KRAMER: You want me to talk to her?
JERRY: I don't think so.
KRAMER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. [shows with his fingers how close it was]
JERRY: That close, huh?
KRAMER: You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it up]
JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
KRAMER: Give me it...let me talk to her [continues this way].
JERRY: [gestures Kramer to shut up] No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on TV]...
KRAMER: A SLIDE!...Wow!
JERRY: ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it [takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on] ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. [hangs up the phone; to Kramer:] I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!
 
[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress]
JERRY: If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.
GEORGE: Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? [sits down]
JERRY: [hands George a beer] Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.
GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?
JERRY: All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...
GEORGE: A decent hotel-room...
JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
GEORGE: You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? [waves with his handkerchief] This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
 
JERRY: [cynical] This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?
GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG [etc.]
KRAMER: [walks in behind the dog and closes the door] He really likes you, George.
GEORGE: [ironically] Well, that's flattering.
KRAMER: [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress on the floor] Is this for that girl?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Why even give her an option?
JERRY: This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on spring break".
GEORGE: Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.
JERRY: Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
GEORGE: So what? That's good.
JERRY: Now, how could that be good?
GEORGE: Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
JERRY: This is how you operate?
GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.
JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.
KRAMER: [stands up from the couch and yells.] WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable.
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: ...How's the real estate-business?
GEORGE:...[surprised he asked] It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.
KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
GEORGE: Well, I might be getting in to that.
KRAMER: [slaps George on the arm] You keep me posted!
GEORGE: I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom door], let's go! [Jerry and the dog come out] You're on stage in 25 minutes.
 
[Scene: Comedy club.]
JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: "I could use a cotton-ball right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss(?) bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?".
 
[Scene: Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura]
JERRY: Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?
GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.
JERRY: Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
GEORGE: Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
JERRY: Really? How?
GEORGE: 'Cause it's all in the greeting.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.
JERRY: Right.
GEORGE: Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.
JERRY: "Lip-area".
GEORGE: Ya know a hug: definitely good.
JERRY: Hug is definitely good.
GEORGE: Sure.
JERRY: Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
GEORGE: That's so brutal, I hate that.
JERRY: Ya know how they do that?
GEORGE: That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.
JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
GEORGE: Hand-sandwich.
JERRY: Right.
GEORGE: I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes]
LAURA: Guess who?
JERRY: Hey, hey.
LAURA and JERRY: Heeeey! [they take each others hands like they're planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled]
JERRY: It's good to see you.
LAURA: Hi.
JERRY: This is my friend George.
LAURA: [shakes George's hand] Hi, how nice to meet you.
GEORGE: Hi, how are you?
JERRY: This is Laura.
GEORGE: Laura, sure.
JERRY: [to Laura] I can't believe you're here.
GEORGE and JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. [they pick up the bags]
LAURA: Oh, thank you.
JERRY: [privately to George] Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
GEORGE: Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.
 
[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment]
JERRY: So uh, what do ya think?
LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.
JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. [Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
LAURA: [laughs] Actually uhm, do you have any wine?
JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.
LAURA: Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? [points to the lamp]
JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. [she turns down the lamp]
LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?
LAURA: No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.
JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?
LAURA: Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.
JERRY: [doubtfully] Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. [pours the wine] I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. [the phone rings; he picks it up] Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. [to Laura] Uhm, it's for you.
LAURA: [she takes the phone] Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye [she hangs up the phone]. Never get engaged.
JERRY: You're engaged?
LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.
JERRY: You're engaged? [still can't believe it]
LAURA: Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.
JERRY: You're engaged! [like he's answering his own question]
LAURA: Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...
JERRY: Yeah.
LAURA: You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.
JERRY: Me too!
 
[Scene: Comedy club.]
JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: [imitates horn]
e-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh, this man is out of ideas. How does it...? [imitates horn again] e-e-e-eeeehhhh, "I don't think she likes me"...The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't we. Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. "Where ever women are?", we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, OK, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene...That's why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: "Where to meet men?". We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve you better.

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why we’re here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about “We should go out”? This is what they’re talking about...this whole thing, we’re all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we’re all out! There are people tryin’ to find us, they don’t know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) “Did you ring?, I can’t find him.” “Where did he go?” “He didn’t tell me where he was going”. He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then you’re standing around, whatta you do? You go: “We gotta be getting back”. Once you’re out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it’s my feeling, you’ve gotta go.



INT. PETE’S LUNCHEONETTE – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a table, having coffee.)

JERRY: (pointing at George’s shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It’s too high! It’s in no-man’s-land. You look like you live with your mother.

GEORGE: Are you through? 

JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?

GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don’t actually recall considering the buttons.

JERRY: Oh, you don’t recall?

GEORGE: (on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.

JERRY: Well, senator, I’d just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.

(A waitress, Claire, approaches the table. She pours refills Jerry’s coffee.)

CLAIRE: Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza. 

(Claire tries to refill George’s coffee, but George blocks her.)

GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where’s the orange indicator?

CLAIRE: It’s missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it’s very challenging work.

JERRY: Can you relax, it’s a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.

CLAIRE: Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.

(Claire exits.)

GEORGE: How come you’re not doin’ the second show tomorrow?

JERRY: Well, there’s this uh, woman might be comin’ in.

GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?

JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?

GEORGE: No, you didn’t!

JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... 

GEORGE: Ha.

JERRY: (looks in the creamer) There’s no milk in here, what...

GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?

JERRY: Oh, she’s really great. I mean, she’s got like a real warmth about her and she’s really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.

GEORGE: (smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?

JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.

GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: This is great!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!

JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we’ll get together. 

GEORGE: (whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, ‘Had to’? ‘Had to’ come in?

JERRY: Yeah, but...

GEORGE: ‘Had to come in’ and ‘maybe we’ll get together’? ‘Had to’ and ‘maybe’?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. You’re not gonna see this woman.

JERRY: What, are you serious...why, why did she call?

GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 

JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!

GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn’t want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: You’re a back-up, you’re a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!

JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.

(Claire passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his notepad.)

GEORGE: Claire, Claire, you’re a woman, right?

CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?

GEORGE: Uhm...I’d like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.

JERRY (to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?

GEORGE: (to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? 

CLAIE: Uh huh.

GEORGE: She says she ‘has to’ come to New York on business...

JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!

GEORGE: ...and, and ‘maybe’ she’ll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?

CLAIRE: I’d have to say, uuhh, no. 

(George shows his note-block to Jerry; it says very largely: NO.)

GEORGE (to Claire) So why did she call?

CLAIRE: To be polite.

GEORGE: To be polite. I rest my case.

JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you’re talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.

GEORGE: I’m not gonna watch you do laundry.

JERRY: Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.

GEORGE: Come on, I’m tired.

CLAIRE: (to Jerry) Don’t worry, I gave him a little caffeine. He’ll perk up.

GEORGE: (panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!

(Claire exits, smiling.)



INT. LAUNDRAMAT - DAY

(Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers.)

GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment I’ve ever experienced. 

(George walks away from the dryer. A man passes by.)

JERRY: Well, look at this guy. Look, he’s got everything, he’s got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners. This is not his first load.

GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...

JERRY: And you didn’t even hear how she sounded.

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Laura.

GEORGE: I can’t believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!

JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?

GEORGE: ‘Cause it’s signals, Jerry, it’s signals! (snapping his fingers) Don’t you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin’ tomorrow night, if you were busy?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn’t make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It’s Saturday night!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What is that? It’s ridiculous! You don’t even know what hotel she’s staying at, you can’t call her. That’s a signal, Jerry, that’s a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!

JERRY: Maybe you’re right.

GEORGE: Maybe I’m right? Of course I’m right.

JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don’t even know where she’s staying! She, she’s not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.

(George puts his arm around Jerry.)

GEORGE: I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why don’t you just see if it’s dry?

JERRY: No no no, don’t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it’s doing. Just let it finish.

GEORGE: You’re gonna overdry it.

JERRY: You, you can’t overdry.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: Same as you can’t overwet. You see, once something is wet, it’s wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you’re dead, right? Let’s say you drop dead and I shoot you. You’re not gonna die again, you’re already dead. You can’t overdie, you can’t overdry.

GEORGE: (to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?

JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? 

(George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it. The dryer stops working and he closes the lid.)

GEORGE: Look at that. They’re done! 



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, peforming.)

JERRY: Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y’know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it’s dark, there’s bubbles happening, they’re all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, “C’mon babe, let’s go”. You come by, you open up the lid and they’ll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they’re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, “Tomorrow, the dryer, I’m goin’. You wait here!” The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you don’t see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So they’re showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first. 



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is on the couch, watching TV. The phone rings. He picks up the reciever.)

JERRY: (answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, don’t say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no 

(There’s a knock at the door.)

JERRY: (to the door) Yeah?

(Kessler enters.)

KESSLER: Are you up?

JERRY: (to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.

(Jerry hangs up.)

KESSLER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? 

JERRY: (upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, it’s a tape! I taped the game, it’s one o’clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.

KESSLER: Hey, I’m sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets, and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat?

JERRY: Meat? I don’t, I don’t know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?

KESSLER: (from the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that’s what happened!

(He takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it.)

KESSLER: You know, I almost wound up going to that game.

JERRY: (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven’t been out of the building in ten years!

KESSLER: Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, “Do you mind?”) Are you done with this?

JERRY: No.

(Kessler glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table.)

KESSLER: When you’re done, let me know.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.

KESSLER: I thought I wasn’t allowed to be in here this weekend.

JERRY: No, it’s okay now, that, that girl is not comin’. Uh, I misread the whole thing.

KESSLER: You want me to talk to her?

JERRY: I don’t think so.

KESSLER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.

(Kessler shows with his fingers how close he was.)

JERRY: That close, huh?

KESSLER: You better believe it.

(The phone rings. Jerry picks it up.)

JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.

KESSLER: Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.

JERRY: (to the phone) No believe me, I’m always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...

KESSLER: (to the TV) SLIDE! Wow!

JERRY: No, it’s, it’s just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, don’t be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it’s no trouble at all... I’ll see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I don’t believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! 



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry and George enter, carrying a heavy mattress.)

JERRY: If my father was moving this he’d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your end’s got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end’s got to come down.'

GEORGE: You know, I can’t believe you’re bringin’ in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why don’t you bring in an extra guy too?

(George takes a seat. Jerry hands him a beer.)

JERRY: Look, it’s a very awkward situation. I don’t wanna be presumptuous.

GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?

JERRY: All right, she said she couldn’t find a decent hotel room...

GEORGE: A decent hotel-room...

JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.

GEORGE: You can’t be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal! 

JERRY: (cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?

GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. 

(Suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George on the couch.)

GEORGE: Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...

(Kessler enters and closes the door.)

KESSLER: Hey, he really likes you, George.

GEORGE: Well, that’s flattering. 

(The dog heads for the bathroom and starts drinking from the toilet.)

KESSLER: Oh, he’s gettin’ a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl?

JERRY: Yeah.

KESSLER: Why even give her an option?

JERRY: This is a person I like, it’s not “How to score on spring break”.

GEORGE: Right, can we go? ‘Cause I’m double-parked, I’m gonna get a ticket.

JERRY: Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.

GEORGE: So what? That’s good.

JERRY: Now, how could that be good?

GEORGE: Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin’ around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin’ over, “I’ve gotta tidy up?” Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.

JERRY: This is how you operate?

GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.

JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.

KESSLER: Why even give her an option for? 

(Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door.)

KESSLER: (to George, pointing at the mattress) It’s unbelievable.

GEORGE: Yeah.

KESSLER: How’s the real estate-business?

GEORGE: (feeling awkward) It’s uh, not bad, it’s comin’ along. Why? Did you need something.

KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?

GEORGE: Well, I might be getting into that.

KESSLER: (slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!

GEORGE: I’m aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, let’s go (opens the bathroom door) Let’s go!

(Jerry and the dog come out.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

(Jerry on stage; performing)

JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it’s a pressure world, it’s a world of tension, it’s a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, ‘cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don’t know what they need. I know I don’t have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I’m- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we’re all human beings, what is the story? I’ve never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I’ve never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: “I could use a cotton-ball right now.” I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they don’t need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they’re like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They’re huge and two days later, they’re out, they’re gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin’ with them? The only time I ever see ‘em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there’s two or three, that look like they’ve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don’t know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl who’s left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I don’t know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. “Let’s move on.” The dating world is a world of pressure. Let’s face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you’ll end up naked at the end of it. You know? “Well, Bill, the boss thinks you’re the man for the position, why don’t you strip down and meet some of the people you’ll be workin’ with?” 



INT. AIRPORT – NIGHT

(Jerry and George are waiting for Laura.)

JERRY: Wouldn’t it be great if you could ask a woman what she’s thinking?

GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she’s thinkin’.

JERRY: You know, instead, I’m like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.

GEORGE: Listen, listen, don’t get worked up, ‘cause you’re gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.

JERRY: Really? How?

GEORGE: ‘Cause it’s all in the greeting. 

JERRY: Uh-huh.

GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that’s a good sign.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.

JERRY: Lip area.

GEORGE: You know a hug: definitely good.

JERRY: Hug is definitely good.

GEORGE: Sure.

JERRY: Although what if it’s one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?

GEORGE: That’s so brutal, I hate that.

JERRY: You know how they do that?

GEORGE: That’s why, you know, a shake is bad.

JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it’s the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?

GEORGE: Hand sandwich.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: I see, well, that’s open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. 

(A woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry’s eyes.)

LAURA: Guess who?

JERRY: Hey, hey.

LAURA & JERRY: Heeeey!

(They take each others hands and shake them around. George is looking puzzled.)

JERRY: It’s good to see you.

LAURA: Hi.

JERRY: This is my friend George.

LAURA: Hi, how nice to meet you.

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

JERRY: This is Laura.

GEORGE: Laura, sure.

JERRY: (to Laura) I can’t believe you’re here.

GEORGE & JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. 

(They pick up the bags.)

LAURA: Oh, thank you.

JERRY: (aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?

GEORGE: Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasn’t in the manual, I don’t know.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is in the midst of showing Laura the apartment.)

JERRY: So uh, what do you think?

LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn’t so bad.

JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?

LAURA: (laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do.

LAURA: (referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?

JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.

(She turns down the lamp.)

LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible – and if it’s not, fine – for me to stay here tomorrow night too?

(Jerry takes off his shoes to make himself comfortable)

JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin’ anything?

LAURA: No, I’d love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I’m right open.

JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?

LAURA: Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but I’d just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.

JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) I’m just, I’m really glad you’re here.

(The phone rings; he picks it up.)

JERRY: (answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, it’s for you.

LAURA: (to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, I’m gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it’s fine... No, we’re goin’ on a boat ride... Don’t be silly... I’m not gonna have this conversation... Look, I’ll call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged.

JERRY: (not excited) You’re engaged?

LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it’s like until you actually do it. And I’m on this emotional roller coaster.

JERRY: You’re engaged? 

LAURA: You know, I can’t believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of “we”. Ugh, it’s a very stressful situation.

JERRY: (matter-of-factly) You’re engaged. 

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, he’s a great guy...

JERRY: Yeah.

LAURA: You’d really like him, you know, I can’t wait to get on that boat.

JERRY: Me too!



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don’t get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I’m not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they’re so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that’s it! It’s the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don’t know ‘bout that, we don’t know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we’ve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! “I don’t think she likes me.” The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don’t we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That’s why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: “Where to meet men?” We’re here, we are everywhere. We’re honking our horns to serve you better.

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...

(He pauses and gestures to audience for response.)
AUDIENCE: Cheque.

JERRY: Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry “draws” imaginary book from a holster.) “Who do I make it out to? There’s my ID.” There’s something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don’t know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, “I don’t have any money, but if you’ll contact these people, I’m sure they’ll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I don’t have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?”



INT. VIDEO STORE – NIGHT

(Jerry and Elaine are picking out a movie for the night.)
JERRY: What’s that one?

ELAINE: “Coccoon II: The Return”. I guess they didn’t like it up there.

JERRY: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y’know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she’s probably screamin’ at those aliens, “I gotta have a lo mein!”

ELAINE: Okay, what’re we doing here? I have seen everything.

JERRY: Oh yeah? I don’t believe you’ve seen... this.

(Jerry shows Elaine a movie from the Adult section.)

ELAINE: Oh, lovely.

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: What do you think their parents think?

JERRY: “So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?” “Oh, he’s a public fornicator. Yes, he’s a fine boy...”

ELAINE: Y’know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela’s birthday.

JERRY: Pamela? Do I know her?

ELAINE: Yeah, you met her when we were going out.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right...

ELAINE: You have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?

JERRY: (quickly) No.

ELAINE: Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?

JERRY: (a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.

ELAINE: Right! In fact... No, never mind...

JERRY: Well, what is it?

ELAINE: Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you don’t want to go to... that... no.

JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.

ELAINE: What little deal?

JERRY: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.

ELAINE: A wedding? Have you lost it, man?

JERRY: Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...

ELAINE: They’re coming in?

JERRY: Yeah, tomorrow.

ELAINE: Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?

JERRY: No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.

ELAINE: Why does he do that?

JERRY: Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?

ELAINE: A wedding?

JERRY: There’s a lot of people to mock...

ELAINE: All right, what the hell.

JERRY: Great!

WOMAN: When you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. You’re not goin’ anywhere...



INT. BAR – NIGHT

(Elaine and Jerry enter.)

ELAINE: C’mon lets go...

JERRY: Was I supposed to bring something?

ELAINE: You could have.

JERRY: I met her one time...

ELAINE: It is not necessary.

JERRY: What did you say then?

ELAINE: Sssshhhhhh!!!

PAMELA: Hi

ELAINE: Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.

PAMELA: (shakes Jerry's hand) Yes, we met.

JERRY: Hi, happy birthday.

PAMELA: Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.

GUESTS, JERRY & ELAINE: Hi

JERRY: I didn’t bring anything.

PAMELA: Uh, I put you two right here.

JERRY: Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to bring, nobody told me.

(Jerry and Elaine sit next to each other at a table. Across from Jerry is a strikingly beautiful woman, Vanessa. The piano is playing awful dinner music.)

VANESSA: How big a tip do you think it’d take to get him to stop?

JERRY: I’m in for five...

VANESSA: I’ll supply the hat.

JERRY: (thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?

VANESSA: Why don’t you relax and take your jacket off?

JERRY: Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.

VANESSA: How masculine.

JERRY: Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) She’s unbelievable!

(The guy beside Vanessa interrupts.)

ROGER: (to Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker.

VANESSA: Oh, you know Bricker! From where?

JERRY: (thinking) What’s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she’s too good to be alone. What’s the difference, I can’t maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.

VANESSA: (to Jerry) How do you know Pamela?

JERRY: Uh, friend of a friend. And you?

VANESSA: We went to law school together.

ELAINE: (interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!

JERRY: (turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.

ELAINE: I had this dream last night and you were in it.

JERRY: Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.

ELAINE: You were you, but, you weren’t you...

JERRY: No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!

ELAINE: I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...

JERRY: (thinking) This is brutal.

ELAINE: You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.

JERRY: How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can’t, I can’t. I’m stuck.

ELAINE: (noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?

JERRY: Yes, I heard you.

PAMELA: Elaine, what’s the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?

JERRY: (thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, you’re a lawyer...

VANESSA: Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

JERRY: (thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.

VANESSA: Oh, that was you?

JERRY: Imagine, spelling “Mom” with two O’s.

VANESSA: Very funny! What do you do?

JERRY: Comedian.

VANESSA: Really? That explains it.

JERRY: (thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

ROGER: Are you ready?

VANESSA: We gotta run. Happy birthday!

(Vanessa and Roger get up an leave. Jerry panics.)

JERRY: (thinking) I can’t believe it. I got nothing! I don’t even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...

(A grim stare from Elaine knocks his concentration.)



INT. TAXICAB – NIGHT

(On the ride home from the party. Jerry and Elaine sit in the back seat.)

JERRY: That wasn’t so bad, really.

ELAINE: Y’know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.

JERRY: Why? What did I do?

ELAINE: Wel-Well, I just don’t appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I’m selling you aluminum siding.

JERRY: I was listening!

ELAINE: No! You couldn’t wait to get back to your little... “conversation”.

JERRY: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.

ELAINE: Uh-huh...

JERRY: Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.

ELAINE: No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn’t have wooden teeth, you did!

JERRY: All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?

ELAINE: So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin’ it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don’t do anything, and go right home. What’d you think? I think it’s going to be big!” I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn’t work. Y’know, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, “Uh, Hi, uh my name’s Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it’s a Riconic relationship.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry’s parents, Helen and Morty, are sitting on a pullout couch. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: Hey!

MORTY: Ah, there he is!

JERRY: This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!

HELEN: Y’know, Jerry, we don’t have to do this.

JERRY: What are you talkin’ about? It’s fine, I love having you here.

HELEN: Tomorrow we’ll go to a hotel.

JERRY: Ma, will you stop?

HELEN: No, why should we take over your apartment?

JERRY: I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.

HELEN: Your friend Kramer doesn’t mind?

JERRY: No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.

JERRY: So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?

MORTY: Depends on the firm.

JERRY: Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?

MORTY: What’s the matter? You need a lawyer?

JERRY: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.

MORTY: So why don’t you ask someone who was at the party?

JERRY: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.

HELEN: Why not?

JERRY: Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.

HELEN: He used to go with her.

HELEN: Which one is she?

MORTY: From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn’t like.

HELEN: Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.

JERRY: Oh yeah, she’s great.

HELEN: So, how come nothing materialized there?

JERRY: Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...

HELEN: I know what it was.

JERRY: You don’t know what it was.

HELEN: So, what was it?

JERRY: Well, we fight a lot for some reason.

HELEN & MORTY: Oh, well...

JERRY: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.

(His parents don’t know how to respond.)

HELEN: Well, I think she’s a very attractive girl.

JERRY: Oh, she is, she absolutely is.

HELEN: I can see if there was a weight problem...

JERRY: No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.

HELEN: You know, you can’t be so particular. Nobody’s perfect.

JERRY: I know, I know...

MORTY: Y’know Jerry, it’s a good thing I wasn’t so particular.

HELEN: (hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So who’re you looking for, Sophia Loren?

JERRY: That’s got nothin’ to do with it.

MORTY: How about Loni Anderson?

HELEN: Where do you get Loni Anderson?

MORTY: Why, what’s wrong with Loni Anderson?

HELEN: I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.

JERRY: What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn’t the one.

HELEN: And this other one’s the one?

JERRY: I dunno, maybe...

MORTY: So ask Elaine there for her number.

JERRY: I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.

HELEN: How could you still see her if your not interested?

JERRY: We’re friends.

MORTY: Doesn’t sound like you’re friends to me. If you were friends you'd-you’d ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?

JERRY: Oh yeah.

MORTY: Well, go up to the office.

HELEN: Up to her office?

MORTY: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn’t she?

JERRY: I guess.

MORTY: So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.

JERRY: You mean stakeout the lobby?

HELEN: Morty, that’s ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!

MORTY: He doesn’t want to ask Elaine for the number.

HELEN: So you’ve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?

MORTY: He pretends he bumped into her!

JERRY: Y’know what? This is not that bad an idea.



INT. OFFICE BUILDING – DAY

(Jerry and George are staking out Vanessa.)

GEORGE: What does she look like?

JERRY: I dunno. Hard to say.

GEORGE: What actress does she remind you of?

JERRY: Loni Anderson.

GEORGE: Loni Anderson?!

JERRY: What, there’s something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.

GEORGE: Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)

JERRY: I’m a little nervous.

GEORGE: Yeah, me too...

JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that I’m doing here in the building?

GEORGE: You came to see me. I work in the building.

JERRY: What do you do?

GEORGE: I’m an architect.

JERRY: You’re an architect?

GEORGE: I’m not?

JERRY: I don’t see architecture comin from you.

GEORGE: (somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.

JERRY: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin’ else.

GEORGE: All right, she’s not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.

JERRY: Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?

GEORGE: We’re having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.

JERRY: What is his name?

GEORGE: Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.

JERRY: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.

GEORGE: No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....

JERRY: Art Cor...

GEORGE: ...velay.

JERRY: Corvelay?

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Well, what does he do?

GEORGE: He’s an importer.

JERRY: Just imports, no exports?

GEORGE: (annoyed) He’s an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?

JERRY: No, I guess she’s still mad.

GEORGE: I don’t understand, you never talk to her about other women?

JERRY: Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. That’s her. On the right.

GEORGE: (anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!

JERRY: You’re you. We’re having lunch with Art Corvelay.

GEORGE: Vandelay!

JERRY: Corvelay!

GEORGE: Let me be the architect! I can do it!

(Jerry ignores George and approaches Vanessa.)

JERRY: Hey, hey. uh Pamela’s birthday party, didn’t I see you there? Jerry.

VANESSA: Sure! Hi!

JERRY: Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) I’m sorry...

VANESSA: Vanessa.

GEORGE: Nice to meet you.

JERRY: Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

VANESSA: That’s right! Yea, what’re you doing here?

JERRY: Oh, we’re meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.

GEORGE: Yeah, Art Vandelay.

VANESSA: Really? Which company?

JERRY & George: (turning to each other) I don’t know. He’s an importer.

VANESSA: Importer?

GEORGE: ...And exporter.

JERRY: He’s an importer/exporter.

GEORGE: (clears his throat) I’m, uh, I’m an architect.

VANESSA: Really. What do you design?

GEORGE: Uh, railroads, uh...

VANESSA: I thought engineers do that.

GEORGE: They can...

JERRY: Y’know I’m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.

VANESSA: Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.

JERRY: Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)

VANESSA: Yeah, and that woman was your...

JERRY: Friend!

GEORGE: I’ll just, uh, get a paper...

JERRY: So, um, do you date uh immature men?

VANESSA: Almost exclusively...



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Helen and Jerry are in the middle of a game of Scrabble. Morty sits on the couch. Helen sings to herself while she tries to form a word.)

HELEN: Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...

JERRY: (annoyed) Ma, will you go already?

HELEN: Bum bum bum bum...

(She picks up a nearby dictionary.)

JERRY: What are you doing?!

HELEN: Wait, I just want to see something.

JERRY: You can’t look in there, we’re playing!

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

MORTY: (cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?

JERRY: Look.

HELEN: “Quo”. Is that a word?

JERRY: Maybe!

HELEN: Will you challenge it?

JERRY: Ma, you can’t look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, she’s cheating!

KRAMER: “Quo”? That’s not a word.

HELEN: (to Jerry) You’re such a stickler...

JERRY: Well put something down, you’re taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they’re all coming over here before the wedding?

HELEN: They’ll be here at two o’clock. Oh, Elaine called. She said she’d be here at two-thirty. And she says “Hope your meeting went well with ‘Art Vandelay’?”

JERRY: She said what?

HELEN: Just what I said, here.

(She hands Jerry the note. He reads it.)

JERRY: She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.

HELEN: She knows what?

JERRY: She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...

(Kramer arranges Mrs. Seinfeld’s tiles, offering her a word.)

HELEN: No, no, no, that won’t do. He may have a “Z”.

MORTY: So, how did she find out?

JERRY: Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.

(While they talk, Kramer has covertly scoped Jerry’s tiles to confirm that Jerry doesn’t have a “Z”. This goes unnoticed by Jerry, who continues to talk with Morty.)

MORTY: So, what are you? Afraid of her?

JERRY: Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?

HELEN: Whatever I wrote down.

JERRY: Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?

HELEN: Who am I, Rich Little?

MORTY: Well, she can’t be too mad. She’s still coming to the wedding.

JERRY: Yeah, but now I’m nervous.

HELEN: Oh, stop it.

(She makes her move and tallies the points.)

JERRY: “Quone”?

HELEN: ...30...31...

JERRY: “Quone”? No, I’m afraid that I’m going to have to challenge that.

(Jerry picks up the dictionary.)

HELEN: ...32...

KRAMER: No, you don’t have to challenge that. That’s a word. That’s a definite word.

JERRY: I am challenging.

KRAMER: Quone. To quone something.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

(Jerry looks up the word.)

HELEN: I’m not playing with you anymore.

MORTY: Quone’s not a word.

JERRY: No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.

HELEN: (to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?

KRAMER: Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY

(A few people mingling about, waiting to go to the wedding. [SeinPurgatory] Jerry is talking to Carol.)

CAROL: You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now that’s a sitcom!

JERRY: You must have quite a time down there.

(Jerry checks his watch.)

CAROL: We got plenty of time.

JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m just waiting for someone.

UNCLE MAC: Watch what you say to this guy. He’ll put it in his next act!

(Carol and Uncle Mac laugh)

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...

UNCLE MAC: Jerry, did I tell you that I’m writing a book? An autobiography.

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.

UNCLE MAC: It’s based on all my experiences!

JERRY: That’s perfect.

(Elaine enters.)

JERRY: Could you excuse me one second? I’m sorry.

(Jerry goes over and greets Elaine.)

JERRY: How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.

ELAINE: Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.

(Awkward sighs from Jerry and Elaine)

JERRY: Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?

ELAINE: Oh no, let’s do it now.

JERRY: All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-

ELAINE: Okay.

ARTIE: Jerry, were you goin’ with us?

JERRY: No, I’m gonna take my car.

ARTIE: That’s why I brought the wagon. Why the hell did I bring the wagon?

JERRY: Anyway, you know why I didn’t ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.

ELAINE: Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.

CAROL: Jerry, we’ll see you there. Bye, Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh, bye. Good to see you.

ARTIE: Oh, we didn’t meet.

JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.

(Jerry pronounces the name ‘le-VEEN’.)

ARTIE: (correcting Jerry) Levine.

(Artie pronounces it with a long “I”. Artie exits.)

JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.

ELAINE: Yeah, obviously.

JERRY: I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.

ELAINE: Couldn’t agree more.

JERRY: Good.

ELAINE: Good.

JERRY: Good.

ELAINE: Great!

JERRY: Great? Where do you get ‘great’?

ELAINE: It’s great to... talk about... other people...

JERRY: ...Guys?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?

ELAINE: No. A general guy.

JERRY: Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...

ELAINE: What? No, it’s not a big deal.

JERRY: No, that’s great! That’s terrific!

ELAINE: No, we just met...

JERRY: Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? I would like to meet him.

ELAINE: Hmmm, I don’t think so.

JERRY: Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?

ELAINE: Wall street.

JERRY: Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.

ELAINE: And he happens to be pretty good lookin’.

JERRY: (pause) All right, sir.

ELAINE: And... he’s hilarious.

JERRY: Now that’s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?

ELAINE: I staked out his health club.

JERRY: Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?

(They leave his apartment)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

Jerry is on stage, performing.

JERRY: Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? It’s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It’s like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, “Look, a rabbit.” The other goes, “So? I believe this is your card.” “Look, why don’t we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?”

INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It’s a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I’m supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it’s supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn’t you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. ‘Cause it’s not easy to give someone the toe, you’ve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) “Look at that toe, buddy.” (He puts his foot down.) I mean, that’s really insulting to get the toe, isn’t it?



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT 

(Jerry is packing a suitcase. Elaine is sitting at the table, watching him.)

JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) That’s it. Done!

ELAINE: (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.

JERRY: (proudly) I am...the master packer.

ELAINE: (laughs) Yeah, right, you’re the master packer.

JERRY: What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) You’ve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.

ELAINE: (raising her hand) ‘Scuse me, master packer...

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Just gimme your keys.

JERRY: All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?

GEORGE: (from the intercom) Yeah.

(Jerry presses the second button, and opens the apartment door.)

ELAINE: Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.

ELAINE: Okay, this is quite a place.

JERRY: There’s more. The refrigerator.

(Jerry opens the fridge.)

JERRY: Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?

ELAINE: I’ll eat out.

JERRY: One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.

(George enters.)

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Ready?

JERRY: Yeah, one sec.

(George closes the door.)

GEORGE: Hey, Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Coming to the airport with us?

ELAINE: No, I’m staying here for the weekend. I’m getting a break from my roommate.

GEORGE: Oh, the actress-waitress?

ELAINE: No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of “A Chorus Line”. So, now all day long she’s walking around the apartment singing, “God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it!” She’s gonna get it right in her...

GEORGE: So just kick her out.

ELAINE: She’s on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.

JERRY: I’m not looking.

GEORGE: No no no, this one’s different. This one’s a beauty!

JERRY: Yeah, what’s it like?

GEORGE: I haven’t seen it yet, but it’s a two-bedroom, it’s on the uh, west 83rd, ‘bout a half block from the park?

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: Uh, twice what you’re payin’ here, but it’s a great building. It’s two bedrooms!

JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerry’s back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.

ELAINE: You oughta at least take a look at it.

JERRY: Really? Why?

ELAINE: ‘Cause then I could move in here.

JERRY: Ohhhh...

ELAINE: It’s time you got outta here anyway.

GEORGE: Yeah, tell ‘im. But quickly, I’m double parked here.

ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can’t have soft cheese...

GEORGE: Let’s not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.

ELAINE: Jerry, come on, you’re doin’ okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn’t have to live like this.

JERRY: Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.

ELAINE: Well, for me it’s a step up. It’s like moving from Iceland to Finland.

GEORGE: Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?

JERRY: I can’t think about it now. Come on, I’m going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
 


INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry enters his apartment with his bags.)

JERRY: Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!

ELAINE: (from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?

JERRY: Great, I had fun. Where’s the TV, where’s the VCR?

(Elaine has a guilty look on her face.)

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: They were stolen.

JERRY: Stolen? When?

ELAINE: A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.

JERRY: Stolen?

(Kramer enters the apartment.)

ELAINE: (looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.

(Elaine enters the bathroom.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) You left the door open?!

KRAMER: Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin’ and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, ‘cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!

JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?

KRAMER: (guiltily) The door.

JERRY: The door? You left the door open?

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.

JERRY: Yeah, and?

KRAMER: Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. “The Bold And The Beautiful”.

JERRY: So the door was wide open?

KRAMER: Wide open!

(Elaine enters the living room.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) And where were you?

ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdale’s... waiting for the shower to heat up.

KRAMER: Look, Jerry, I’m sorry, I’m uh- you have insurance, right buddy?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: (shocked) How can you not have insurance?

JERRY: Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It’s the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!

KRAMER: Jerry! I’m gonna find your stuff. I’m gonna solve it, I’m on the case, buddy, I’m on the case.

JERRY: Yeah, don’t investigate, don’t pay me back, it was an accident.

KRAMER: (theatrical) I made a mistake.

ELAINE: These things happen.

KRAMER: I’m human.

JERRY: In your way.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(A policeman is filling out a report. Jerry and Elaine are there.)

POLICEMAN: Let’s see, that’s, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that ‘bout it?

ELAINE: Answering machine.

JERRY: (disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.

POLICEMAN: What do you mean?

JERRY: It’s a joke.

POLICEMAN: I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we’ll look into it and uh, we’ll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything.

JERRY: You ever find anything?

POLICEMAN: No.

(Policeman hands Jerry his copy of the report.)

JERRY: Well, thanks anyway.

POLICEMAN: You bet.

(Policeman leaves the apartment, while George enters.)

ELAINE: I didn’t get that joke either.

JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages aren’t for him. He’s the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?

(George slaps his right hand on his left elbow, and vice versa, acting like a genie.)

GEORGE : I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.

JERRY: Again?

GEORGE: I don’t know how you put up with this.

ELAINE: Yeah, tell ‘im George.

JERRY: (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?

ELAINE: Yes! You don’t understand. I’m living with Ethel Merman without the talent.

JERRY: (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?

(George shows him the keys.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it’s very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, “Call the police. You really should call the police.” So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, “Yeah, I’m calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I’m gonna see some real action.” Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don’t really think we’re gonna crack this case, do you? It’s not like Batman, where there’s three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. “Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, he’s dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, he’s a PENGUIN!



INT. THE APARTMENT ON 83RD STREET – DAY

(George, Elaine and Jerry are entering the apartment.)

ELAINE: Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?

(Elaine takes a closer look at the fireplace.)

GEORGE: I didn’t know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.

JERRY: How do you get all that wood in here?

ELAINE: They deliver it.

JERRY: They deliver wood?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: What do you tip a wood guy?

(George looks intensively at the apartment description.)

GEORGE: I didn’t know there was a fireplace.

ELAINE: Look! Look at- look at this! There’s a garden.

GEORGE: A garden! I can’t believe there’s a garden!

JERRY: Would I have to get a gardener?

ELAINE: Yeah, you can get a gardener.

JERRY: You tip him?

ELAINE: You can.

GEORGE: (to Elaine) You don’t tip a gardener!

ELAINE: You can tip a gardener.

GEORGE: You don’t need a gardener.

ELAINE: Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

JERRY: They deliver the coal?

ELAINE: Sure, it’s...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.

JERRY: Oh, then I gotta tip him.

ELAINE: Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!

JERRY: I don’t have any plants.

GEORGE: I have plants. (snorts)

ELAINE: Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I’m walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) It’s a walk-in. Can you believe it? I’m nuts about this, what do you think?

(Jerry closes the door, with Elaine still in it.)

JERRY: I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?

GEORGE: It’s your decision.

(Jerry walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying his every move. Suddenly Jerry stops walking. Elaine is not able to copy this move; they look at each other, laughing.)

JERRY: I’m takin’ it, I’m takin’ the place. I’m gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I’m livin’ here...I’m movin’.

ELAINE: (laughing with joy) Your movin’? That means I’m movin’. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isn’t that incredible!

GEORGE: (unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
 


INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are there.)

ELAINE: What about the couch?

JERRY: You like the couch? I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: You’re movin’ in, you’re a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don’t even wanna see it, go, get it out.

ELAINE: A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?

JERRY: Yeah!

ELAINE: For this couch?!

(Jerry shuts the apartment door.)

JERRY: Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?

ELAINE: Okay, uh, I’ll tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I don’t know, maybe...twenty dollars?

(Jerry looks at her as if to say, “You can’t be serious.” The apartment buzzer goes off. Jerry speaks over the intercom.)

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: (from the intercom) Yeah, it’s George.

JERRY: Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, I’m gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) I’m just gonna pack up the cushions right now...

ELAINE: Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.

JERRY: (continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, ‘cause I wanna get it in the hall.

(He is about to lift up the couch.)

ELAINE: Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?

JERRY: Fifty dollars?

ELAINE: Uh-huh.

JERRY: Thank you very much.

ELAINE: Thank you very much.

(George enters and closes the door.)

GEORGE: Hey, what’s goin’ on?

ELAINE: I just bought Jerry’s couch for fifty dollars.

JERRY: (to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.

GEORGE: (frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: If you’re having second thoughts, if you didn’t want it, don’t worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.

JERRY: You could take it? You want it?

GEORGE: No, I don’t want it. I want it, if you don’t want it.

JERRY: So you do want it.

GEORGE: No I, I want it if you don’t want it.

JERRY: You just said you wanted it!

GEORGE: No, I’m saying, if a situation arose in which you didn’t want it, I might take it.

(Jerry picks up the lease and hands it to George.)

JERRY: So take it.

GEORGE: How can I take it?

JERRY: How can I take it?

GEORGE: It’s your apartment!

JERRY: How can I want it now, if you want it?

ELAINE: Excuse me, uh, I don’t mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?

GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it.

JERRY: I...am not taking it.

(He drops the lease demonstratively on his line.)

ELAINE: Well, one of you better damn well take it!

JERRY: Well, whaddaya wanna do here?

GEORGE: I, I don’t know.

JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin?

GEORGE: Who flips? You’ll flip, I’ll call.

JERRY: Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that’s it. Agreed?

GEORGE: I’m good.

ELAINE: I don’t know, who to root for, George’s place has carpeting.

(George "shushes" Elaine)

JERRY: All right, now you call it in the air.

GEORGE: No catchin’.

JERRY: No no.

GEORGE: Flip it.

(Jerry flips the coin.)

GEORGE: Heads!

(The coin hits the table. It falls on the floor. They all look intently at the coin.)

JERRY: Tails!

GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table.

JERRY: So what?

GEORGE: Interference! You can’t count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.

JERRY: You didn’t call no interference!

GEORGE: You don’t have to call that! That’s a rule!

JERRY: I don’t believe this.

GEORGE: Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!

JERRY: I don’t wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?

ELAINE: I’d better not.

JERRY: Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that’s it, you gotta win three.

GEORGE: Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. I’ll choose you. Whaddaya want?

JERRY: Odds.

GEORGE: I want evens.

JERRY: Good.

GEORGE: You got odds.

JERRY: You got evens.

GEORGE: Right, ready?

JERRY: For the apartment.

(They take their choose positions.)

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

(George walks to the table to take a break. They resume their positions.)

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Mine!

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

(Jerry wins. Elaine starts measuring up Jerry’s couch.)

GEORGE: Congratulations...congratulations.

JERRY: Thanks.

GEORGE: I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?

(Kramer slides into the apartment.)

KRAMER: Jerry, I think I’m on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: The last couple a days he’s been acting very strange. I think he’s avoiding me.

JERRY: Hard to imagine.

KRAMER: Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, “Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.”

KRAMER: ..you know, very casually,

JERRY: Right.

KRAMER: (cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.

ELAINE: So what did he say?

KRAMER: “What stuff?”

JERRY: Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!

KRAMER: No, you don’t understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I’m gonna go over there, I’m gonna borrow some tea. If I don’t get back in five minutes, maybe you’d better call the police.

JERRY: Okay, starting...NOW!

(Jerry looks at his watch.)

KRAMER: Yeah!

(Kramer darts off.)

 

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when you’re a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, “I got the front seat” “I wanted the front seat!” “I called it”. And the other kid knows he’s got nothing to say: “He called it. What can I do?” If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. “Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat” And the judge would go, “Did he call it?” “Well no, he didn’t call-” BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) “He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry is sitting at a table, George returns from the bathroom.)

GEORGE: I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don’t know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I don’t know if it’s the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.

JERRY: It’s a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin’?

GEORGE: I don’t know, I can’t eat. You, you can’t have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, I’m sittin’ here with a carrot! They’re closing in on a hundred, I’m sayin’ to them, “How can you eat that stuff?” (They look at their menus again.) I’m so sick about losin’ that choose, you don’t know.

JERRY: All right, forget it, forget it. I’m not taking the place!

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: How can I live there?

GEORGE: Why not?!

JERRY: Look at you, you’re still thinking about it. I’ll never feel comfortable.

GEORGE: Oh, get outta here.

JERRY: How can I ever have you over? You’ll sit there moping.

GEORGE: I won’t mope.

JERRY: You’re already moping! Would you take the place?

GEORGE: No, impossible! It’s your apartment.

JERRY: You found the place.

GEORGE: You won the choose.

JERRY: All right, forget it, it’s over, I’m not moving.

GEORGE: Well, me neither.

JERRY: Definitely?

GEORGE: Definitely.

JERRY: Alright, then just get rid of it. You won’t have any problem.

GEORGE: No, it’s not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.

(A waitress, Carol, approaches.)

CAROL: What apartment?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s a great place, it’s uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd ‘bout half block from the park.

CAROL: What’s the rent?



INT. THE APARTMENT ON 83RD STREET – DAY

(The housewarming party for Carol, the waitress. Jerry, Elaine and George are invited to the house, they’re sitting on a couch, all three moping.)

GEORGE: I don’t know, what we’re doin’ here, this is ridiculous.

JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.

ELAINE: I can’t believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.

(She slaps Jerry on the leg.)

JERRY: If only the coin hadn’t hit the table.

GEORGE: The table is interference, you know it!

JERRY: It is not!

GEORGE: It is too!

ELAINE: My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on “Carousel”.

(Carol approaches them.)

CAROL: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi, Carol.

CAROL: I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.

(Jerry, Elaine and George get up. )

CAROL: This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.

LARRY: Oh, you don’t know how grateful I am, if there’s anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we’re just so thrilled with this place.

CAROL: It’s a dream.

LARRY: I’m running in the park now, I’ve lost weight, we’re barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable.

GEORGE: We’re really glad for you.

ELAINE: Couldn’t be happier.

JERRY: It’s wonderful.

(They sit down again.)

CAROL: Diane, Diane, come here.

(Diane comes to the couch. She is very attractive.)

CAROL: This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.

(Jerry, Elaine and George get up.)

CAROL: (to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. She’s a masseuse!

DIANE: How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it’s such a great location and it’s...so close to the park.

GEORGE: We’re aware of the proximity to the park, yes.

DIANE: Well, it was nice to meet you.

(Diane walks away.)

GEORGE: Nice meeting you.

(George shakes Carol’s hand. The three sit down again. Carol walks away.)

JERRY: How late are the stores open? I’m thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.

(Two men are standing behind the couch, talking.)

MAN #1: I get a call from Gilmour this morning, and get this: they’re restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I gotta be there on the first of the month.

MAN #2: Really? What are you gonna ‘bout the apartment?

MAN #1: Well, what can I do? Give it up.

JERRY, GEORGE & ELAINE: What’s the rent?

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy’s out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it’s true, men hear a drill, it’s like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, “Honey, I think Jim’s working on something over there.” So they run over to the guy. Now they don’t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That’s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, “What are you using, a Phillips-head?” You know, we feel involved. That’s why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that’s just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don’t cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. “What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that’ll hold.”



INT. JERRY’S LOBBY – DAY

(Jerry and George are waiting for the elevator.)

GEORGE: I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.

JERRY: I don’t think you did anything wrong.

GEORGE: I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don’t tell you.

JERRY: We can only thank God for that.

(Elevator opens. They get on.)

GEORGE: I’m outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It’s only a matter of time now.

JERRY: You’re imagining this. Really.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no.

(Elevator doors close.)



INT. ELEVATOR – CONTINUING

GEORGE: I’ll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.

JERRY: What floss? When?

GEORGE: We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there’s this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.

JERRY: Ah, mint.

GEORGE: Of course. So, I’m looking at it. I look up, I see she’s looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..

(Elevator doors open. They get off.)

JERRY: So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.

GEORGE: If I didn’t put that floss in my pocket, I’d be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.

(They approach Jerry’s apartment.)

JERRY: And you’re sure the floss was the catalyst?

GEORGE: Yes, I am.

JERRY: You don’t think it might’ve had anything to do with that?

(Jerry points to George’s fanny pack.)

GEORGE: What? You don’t like this?

JERRY: It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.

(They enter Jerry’s apartment)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – CONTINUING

(Kramer is on the couch, talking on the phone.)

KRAMER: (to the phone) Oh, they’ve got a cure for cancer. See, it’s all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.

(Kramer hands the phone to Jerry.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Who is it?

KRAMER: Take it.

JERRY: Who is it?

KRAMER: It’s for you.

JERRY: (to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesn’t know anything. He’s just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I’m meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday’s okay... All right. Uh, I’m a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.

KRAMER: Well, it’s your phone. He wanted to talk to you.

JERRY: Maybe I didn’t want to talk to him.

KRAMER: Well, why not?

JERRY: He bothers me. I don’t even answer the phone anymore because of him. He’s turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.

GEORGE: What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We’re not going?

JERRY: We’re going. That’s next Wednesday.

GEORGE: Oh. Who is this guy?

JERRY: His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would’ve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. He’s so self-involved.

(Kramer’s cordless phone rings. Kramer pulls it out of his pocket.)

KRAMER: That’s for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...

JERRY: Can you conduct your business elsewhere?

KRAMER: (ignoring Jerry) No no no. I’m talking about a whole chain of ‘em. Yeah.

(Kramer leaves Jerry’s apartment while still on the phone.)

GEORGE: I don’t know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I’ll tell you that.

JERRY: I don’t bother with him. He’s been calling me for seven years. I’ve never called him once! He’s got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he’s paying attention.

GEORGE: I don’t understand why you spend time with this guy.

JERRY: What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, “I don’t think we’re right for each other.” He’s a guy! At least with a woman, there’s a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.

GEORGE: No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.

JERRY: Just break up with him?

GEORGE: Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.

JERRY: The Truth.

(They both careen)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing)

JERRY: As a guy I don’t know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don’t know how to say, “Bill, I feel I need to see other men.” Do you know what I mean? There’s nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that’s the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they’re two guys. That’s almost all we need to have in common. ‘Cause sports – sports and women – is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, “So, what’s in the refrigerator?”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and Joel are sitting at a table.)

JOEL: ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.

JERRY: You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-

JOEL: (to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, we’re starving here! We’ve been waiting here for ten minutes already!

JERRY: (testing Joel) So, I’m thinking about going to Iran this summer.

JOEL: I have to eat! I mean, I’m hypoglycemic.

JERRY: Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, it’s their annual terrorist luncheon.

JOEL: Yeah.

JERRY: (cont'd) I’m gonna do it in Farsi.

JOEL: Do you think I need a haircut?

(A waitress approaches their table.)

CLAIRE: Are you ready?

JERRY: Yeah, I’ll have the egg salad on whole wheat.

JOEL: (to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don’t want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.

WAITRESS: I think it’s real turkey.

JOEL: Is there a real bird in the back?

WAITRESS: No, there’s not bird but-

JOEL: Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don’t you do me a favor. Why don’t you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.

JERRY: How can you talk to someone like that?

JOEL: What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?

JERRY: Listen, Joel. There’s something I have to tell you...

JOEL: (laughing) Wait, you’ll never guess who I ran into.

(Joel pushes out his ears as a hint to Jerry.)

JERRY AND JOEL: Howard Metro.

JOEL: He asked me if I still saw you. I said, “Sure, I see him all the time. We’re still great friends.” Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)

JERRY: Listen, Joel, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.

JOEL: What?

JERRY: This friendship: It’s not working.

JOEL: Not working? What are you talking about?

JERRY: We’re just not suited to be friends.

JOEL: How can you say that?

JERRY: Look, you’re a nice guy, it’s just that... we don’t have anything in common.

JOEL: (starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.

JERRY: Y-You didn’t do anything. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s- this is very difficult.

JOEL: Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you’re a very busy guy.

JERRY: No, it’s not that.

JOEL: (crying) You’re one of the few people I can talk to.

JERRY: Oh, come on. That’s not true.

JOEL: I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, I’m your biggest fan!

JERRY: I know, I know.

JOEL: I mean, you’re my best friend.

JERRY: Best friend- I’ve never been to your apartment.

JOEL: I cannot believe that this is happening. I can’t believe it.

JERRY: Okay, okay. Forget it. It’s okay. I didn’t mean it.

JOEL: Didn’t mean what?

JERRY: What I said. I’ve been under a lot of stress.

JOEL: Oh, you’ve been under a lot of stress.

JERRY: Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I took it out on you. We’re still friends. We’re still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I’ll tell you what. I’ve got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.

(Joel’s tears are clearing up.)

JOEL: Tonight?

JERRY: No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would’ve said tonight.

JOEL: Do you really want me to go?

JERRY: (lying) Yes.

JOEL: Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that’d be great. So, next Wednesday.

JERRY: Next Wednesday.

JOEL: Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!



INT. BANK – DAY

(Jerry is at the counter, filling out a slip. George is carrying a jug full of change.)

GEORGE: ...she calls me up at my office

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: (cont'd) she says, “We have to talk.”

JERRY: Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.

GEORGE: That, or “Who’s bra is this?”

JERRY: That is worse.

GEORGE: So we order lunch, and we’re talking. Finally, she blurts out how it’s ‘not working’.

JERRY: Really.

GEORGE: So, I’m thinking, as she’s saying this, I’m thinking: great, the relationship’s over. But the egg salad’s on the way. So now I have a decision: Do I walk or do I eat?

JERRY: Hm. You ate.

GEORGE: We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.

JERRY: Someone says, “Get out of my life,” and that doesn’t affect your appetite?

GEORGE: Have you ever had their egg salad?

JERRY: It is unbelievable.

GEORGE: It’s unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn’t even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.

(Jerry looks at George’s jug of change.)

JERRY: How much could you possibly have in there?

GEORGE: It’s my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.

JERRY: Yeah? Where’d he go, to an arcade?

GEORGE: (sarcastically) That’s funny. You’re a funny guy.

JERRY: C’mon, move up.

(George moves up in the bank line. There’s a customer in front of him.)

CUSTOMER: Oh great, Ewing’s hurt.

GEORGE: Ewing’s hurt? How long is he going to be out?

CUSTOMER: A couple of days at the most but...

GEORGE: Geez.

JERRY: Oh, God.

GEORGE: I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.

JERRY: Listen, George, little problem with the game.

GEORGE: What about it?

JERRY: The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I gave your ticket to Horneck.

GEORGE: (not believing him) You what?!

JERRY: Yeah, I’m sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.

GEORGE: No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?

JERRY: C’mon, c’mon, go ahead, move up.

GEORGE: Why did you give him my ticket for?

JERRY: You didn’t see him. It was horrible.

GEORGE: Oh, c’mon, Jerry. I can’t believe this.

JERRY: I had to do it.

(George is up to the teller. Jerry goes to another one.)

GEORGE: Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?

TELLER: I’m sorry, sir. We can’t do that.

JERRY: Do you want to go with him? You go. I don’t mind.

GEORGE: I’m not going with him. I don’t even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.

TELLER: Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.

GEORGE: You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!



INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: No, I do not like the bank. I’ve heard the expression “Laughing all the way to the bank.” I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there’s nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it’s empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) “Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I’m almost at the front. I’d like a reward for this please.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is stuffing pennies into rolls.)

GEORGE: ...thirty-two, thirty-three-

JERRY: George.

(George puts up his hand.)

GEORGE: Not now.

(George counts to himself.)

JERRY: Could you stop the counting?

(George loses count.)

GEORGE: Nnnnnnngaaa!

(He dumps out roll.)

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Can I make it up to you? I’ll give you fifty bucks for the jug.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

JERRY: Well, then I’m not going to the game either. Okay? I’ll give him both tickets.

GEORGE: Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!

JERRY: I- no, I don’t want to go.

GEORGE: He was really crying?

JERRY: I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I’ll just make up some excuse why I can’t go to the game either.

GEORGE: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you’re going to lie to the guy, why don’t you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?

JERRY: George, the man wept.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Oh, hey guys. Man, I’m telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.

GEORGE: This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?

KRAMER: Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.

GEORGE: You know, you have to know how to do that. You can’t have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!

KRAMER: It’s all supervised.

GEORGE: Oh, well...

KRAMER: All of it. You want to invest?

GEORGE: My money’s all tied up in change right now.

KRAMER: No, I’m tellin’ you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.

JERRY: I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can’t imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that’s me. Alright

KRAMER: That’s you.

JERRY: I’m just saying..Alright.

KRAMER: Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.

JERRY: Okay.

KRAMER: You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.

(Kramer exits quickly, then sticks his head back through the door.)

KRAMER: One day, you’ll beg me to make your own pie.

(Kramer exits for good. Jerry dials Joel’s number.)

JERRY: (to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can’t make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he’s got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They’re at the Will-Call window... And I’m really sorry... Have a good time... We’ll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don’t... Fine.. Fine... Bye.

(He hangs up.)

GEORGE: Trapezoid?

JERRY: I know. I’m really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Elaine and Jerry are there.)

ELAINE: Come on, let’s go do something. I don’t wanna just sit around here.

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Want to go get something to eat?

JERRY: Where do you want to go?

ELAINE: I don’t care, I’m not hungry.

JERRY: We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.

ELAINE: What are we gonna do there? Talk?

JERRY: We could talk.

ELAINE: I’ll go if I don’t have to talk.

JERRY: Then we’ll just sit there.

ELAINE: Okay. I’m gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...

JERRY: Okay, just hand that over, please.

ELAINE: Oh, what is this?

JERRY: It’s a list of excuses, it’s for that guy, Horneck, who’s at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don’t have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?

ELAINE: I got some for you.

JERRY: I don’t need any more.

ELAINE: No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen: You ran out of underwear, you can’t leave the house.

JERRY: (not amused) Very funny.

ELAINE: How about: You’ve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. You’re not even you. You’re Dan.

JERRY: I’m Dan. Can I have my list back, please?

(Elaine gives Jerry the list.)

ELAINE: Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you’re doing this. This is absolutely infantile.

JERRY: What can I do?

ELAINE: Deal with it. Be a man!

JERRY: Oh no. That’s impossible. I’d rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.

ELAINE: You made a man cry? I’ve never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn’t cry. I got the cab.

JERRY: Couple of tough monkeys.

(Elaine laughs. Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!

JERRY: Game?

KRAMER: Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!

JERRY: Wait. How does Horneck know you?

KRAMER: Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He’s really into my pizza place idea!

JERRY: This is too much.

ELAINE: Wait, what pizza place idea?

JERRY: Oh, no.

KRAMER: You get to make your own pie!

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.

KRAMER: Yea.

JOEL: (from the hallway) Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Perfect.

(Joel enters.)

JOEL: Hey.

KRAMER: Okay, who wants meatloaf?

JERRY & ELAINE: No thanks.

KRAMER: (to Joel) It’s gonna be hot in a minute.

(Kramer exits.)

JOEL: So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?

JERRY: Oh, we finished early.

JOEL: M-hm, I’ll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your ‘nephew’?

(Elaine laughs)

JERRY: Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

ELAINE: Hi.

JOEL: Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?

JERRY: We’re still friends.

JOEL: So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I’m going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why don’t you come along?

ELAINE: Oh, no no. Tuesday’s uh no good becasue we’ve got choir practice.

JERRY: Right. I forgot about choir.

ELAINE: We-We’re doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.

JERRY: Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.

JOEL: What about Thursday night? I mean they’re playing the Sonics.

(Jerry shakes his head.)

ELAINE: Huh... Thursday is no good because we’ve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.

JOEL: You know, I should really try something like that.

JERRY: You really should.

JOEL: Well, let’s just take a look here.

(Horneck looks at his schedule.)

JOEL: Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night we’ve got the Mavericks. If you don’t like the Mavericks, next Tuesday: Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let’s see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You can’t miss Air Jordan...



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: You know, I really... I’ve come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they’re just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don’t really wanna see them. You don’t call them, they call you. You don’t call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don’t really have anything in common with is to pretend you’re hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there’s a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there’s no way you can say, “Hey, it’s been great having you on the show. We’re out of time.”

JERRY: Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money’s a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don’t care about money when you’re hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you’re like the ruler of an empire. “More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives.” Then after the meal, you know, you’ve got the pants open, you’ve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They’re mystified by the check. “What is this? How could this be?” They start passing it around the table, “Does this look right to you? We’re not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a booth.)

JERRY: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny.

JERRY: But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed. I’m sure he’s got super humor.

GEORGE: You would think that, but either you’re born with a sense of humor, or you’re not. It’s not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.

JERRY: Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But he ain’t funny.

(Elaine joins them. The boys check their watches.)

ELAINE: I know, I know. I’m sorry I’m late.

JERRY: No problem.

ELAINE: I dropped a grape.

GEORGE: Pardon?

ELAINE: I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn’t find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.

JERRY: Were you crying? I mean, it’s just a grape. You’ll find it.

ELAINE: No, I’m just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I’m going out with...

JERRY: Robert.

ELAINE: Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and I’m allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can’t even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor’s studio so we can’t go there. It’s really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won’t even go away for the weekend because of these cats.

GEORGE: Guys with cats... I don’t know.

JERRY: I’ve been thinking about asking this girl I’m, uh, seeing-

ELAINE: Vanessa.

JERRY: Vanessa, thank you. I’ve been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no no. I’d have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let’s see, you’re going to be with her seventy-two hours. That’s a dating decathlon.

ELAINE: (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don’t you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She’ll love it.

GEORGE: That’s exquisite. Listen, uh, if it’s not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?

(Elaine gets the paper, and George starts flipping through it.)

JERRY: You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.

(Elaine gives Jerry a look)

GEORGE: Up again?! This is incredible! I’m.. I’m getting it.

ELAINE: You’re getting what?

GEORGE: A stock.

JERRY: What stock?

GEORGE: Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?

JERRY: Maybe.

GEORGE: He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he’s got some new thing. You know, there’s supposed to be a big merger. He wasn’t even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.

JERRY: How high’s it suppose to go?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?

JERRY: Boy... I don’t know.

ELAINE: I’d do it but I don’t have any money.

JERRY: What kind of company is it?

GEORGE: It’s called Sendrax. They’ve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.

ELAINE: Televising opera?

GEORGE: Some sort of electronic thingy.

JERRY: Well, how much are you going to invest?

GEORGE: Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.

JERRY: Boy...

GEORGE: C’mon. Wilkinson’s got millions invested in this stock. It’s gone up three points since I’ve been watching it.

JERRY: What if I lose it?

GEORGE: C’mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We’ll do it together. Come on, come on. We’re in it together.

JERRY: All right. Twenty-five hundred.

GEORGE: That’s it.

(The waitress arrives.)

WAITRESS: Yeah, can I take your order?

GEORGE: (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.

JERRY: My bet? All right. I’ll open with a tuna sandwich.

ELAINE: Tuna?

JERRY: Oh, the dolphin thing?

ELAINE: They’re dying in the nets.

JERRY: Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.

ELAINE: Jerry, can’t you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?

JERRY: Hey, when I’m driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I’m always waving everybody in. “Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.” ...All right. All right. I’ll have a chicken salad.

ELAINE: And I’m going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.

WAITRESS: Okay. (To George) What about you?

GEORGE: I’ll have the tuna.



INT. SUPERMARKET – NIGHT

(Jerry and Vanessa are on a date.)

JERRY: I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.

VANESSA: Why didn’t you do something?

JERRY: What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, I’m risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?

STOCK BOY: No puffs. Just flakes.

JERRY : Have you thought any more about that trip?

VANESSA: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it.

JERRY: You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.

VANESSA: I don’t know. I just worry about trips like this. It’s a lot of pressure.

JERRY: It’s great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It’s like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.

VANESSA: Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?

JERRY: Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.

VANESSA: Really? Could we go fishing up there?

JERRY: Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?

VANESSA: They have marlin in Vermont?

JERRY: Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)

(Jerry picks up a newspaper.)

VANESSA: Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.

JERRY : I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is looking at a road map. Kramer enters with a newspaper.)

JERRY: Is that my paper?

KRAMER: Bad news, my friend.

JERRY: What? What news?

KRAMER : Sendrax.

JERRY: Oh, c’mon! It’s down again?!

KRAMER: Two and a half points.

JERRY: Oh, I can’t believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) That’s four and a half points in three days! That’s almost half my money!

KRAMER: Hey, I told you.

JERRY: (sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.

KRAMER: It’s all manipulated with junk bonds. You can’t win.

(Jerry picks up the reciever of his phone, and dials.)

JERRY: There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.

KRAMER: Hey, I don’t care. I’m just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!

JERRY: (to the phone) George, what’s going on?!

KRAMER: Sell it, just say I’m selling!

JERRY: (to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my money’s gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn’t been home or in his office in the past three days!

KRAMER: You know, I can’t believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could’ve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.

JERRY: Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?

KRAMER: Okay, you’re in a restaurant. You’ve got a very big meeting coming up...

JERRY: Okay...

KRAMER: (looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!

JERRY: (going along with it) Oh No!

KRAMER: You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then you’re gone.

JERRY: You’re gone all right.

KRAMER: (Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...

JERRY: Yeah, I’m going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.

KRAMER: Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.

JERRY: What friends?

KRAMER: Well, it’s just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) ‘Cause they’re really good people, Jerry. I’m telling you. You know, they’re anarchists. They’re.. they’re.. they’re.. huge.

(Jerry answers the phone.)

JERRY: George- What?! You’re kidding... Well, what’s wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I’ll speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy who’s supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he’s in the hospital.

(Kramer smiles.)



INT. DRY CLEANERS – DAY

(Jerry and George are in line. )

JERRY: So you don’t know what’s wrong with him?

GEORGE: All Simons was able to find out is that he’s in the hospital.

JERRY: Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?

GEORGE: Of course he’s been in touch with him. He’s left two messages. He just hasn’t heard back yet, that’s all.

JERRY: Well, this is it. I’m selling.

GEORGE: Just give it a little more time.

JERRY: I never should’ve gotten involved in this. I’m a nervous wreck. I’m not cut out for investing.

GEORGE: All right, all right. That’s it. I’m gonna go down there.

JERRY: Where?

GEORGE: To the hospital.

JERRY: The hospital?

GEORGE: I’m going to find out what’s going on. All right?

JERRY: Are you nuts? You don’t even know the guy.

GEORGE: So what? I’ll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I’ll work my way around to it.

JERRY: What if he’s in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) “How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?” (He makes a hissing sound.) “By the way, what’s happening with Sendrax?”

GEORGE: Maybe he’s resting.

JERRY: Who goes to the hospital to rest?

GEORGE: What are you, a doctor?

JERRY: Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?

GEORGE: Today. I’m going today. Just don’t do anything until you hear from me.

JERRY: All right.

(Jerry moves up in line; a woman takes his place. George does not notice.)

GEORGE: (to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.

(Woman gives him a look.)

DRY CLEANER: (to Jerry) May I help you?

JERRY: Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It’s completely shrunk. There’s absolutely no way I can wear it.

DRY CLEANER: When did you bring it in?

JERRY: What’s the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!

DRY CLEANER: You got a receipt?

JERRY: I can’t find the receipt.

DRY CLEANER: You should get the receipt.

JERRY: Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It’s a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!

DRY CLEANER: Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?

JERRY: What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don’t even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That’s what I want. I want an admission of guilt.

DRY CLEANER: Maybe you asked for it to be washed.

JERRY: No! Dry-cleaned.

DRY CLEANE: Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-

JERRY: You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!

DRY CLEANER: (looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it.



INT. COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, “Well, it’s ruined.” And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, “It’s not our fault. We’re not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.” You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They’re cleaning our clothes, but they’re not getting anything wet. It’s all dry. I know there’s gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they’re using. There’s no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) That’s dry cleaning. I don’t think that’s what they’re doing back there. They don’t have eighty guys going, “Come on, hurry up! There’s a lot of shirts today!”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry and Elaine are there. Elaine sneezes.)

JERRY: Bless you.

ELAINE: Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they’re clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can’t count to ten, so don’t give me hygiene.

JERRY : So what are you gonna do?

ELAINE: I don’t know. I can’t think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?

JERRY: Well, it couldn’t be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?

ELAINE: What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?

JERRY: I’m no cat killer.

ELAINE: How about we go over there right now and we shave them?

JERRY: I’d really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.

ELAINE: He actually went to the hospital?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Oh man, he’s nuts.

JERRY: Yeah, he’s nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. It’s down again.

KRAMER: How much are you down altogether?

JERRY: I don’t know.. fifteen hundred dollars.

KRAMER: Wow.

JERRY: You don’t have to say “Wow.” I know it’s “Wow.” (Kramer smiling) And there’s that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) It’s George.

(Jerry presses the button to let George in. Elaine goes into the bathroom. Kramer picks up some binoculars and looks out the window.)

KRAMER: Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.

JERRY: I really don’t need to look.

KRAMER: What a body. Yeeaahh. That’s for me.

JERRY: Yeah, and you’re just what she’s looking for too – a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.

KRAMER: I’m gonna go down there and try and talk to her.

(Kramer exits. George enters and flops onto the couch.)

JERRY: What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you what’s gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?

GEORGE: Fifteen seconds.

JERRY: You told him you knew Simons?

GEORGE: Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I’m in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I’ll tell you one thing. I don’t know what he’s got. But for a sick guy, he’s very strong.

(Elaine exits bathroom.)

JERRY: Well, that’s it. Look, I’m going to Vermont. I don’t want to think about this. I’m selling.

ELAINE: Didn’t work, huh?

GEORGE: (laughs) Not quite.

ELAINE: We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?

GEORGE: I’m keeping it. I’m going down with the ship.



INT. COUNTRY INN’S LOBBY - DAY

(Jerry and Vanessa are well into their weekend together. It’s raining outside.)

JERRY: So I know this guy. I’m getting all my sneakers at a discount now.

VANESSA: I know. You mentioned it.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right.

JERRY: (thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I’ve still got another day! I’ve got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) That’s a nice watch. Do you wind it?

VANESSA: No, it’s got a little battery.

JERRY: Well, that’s good.

JERRY: (thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I’m speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don’t care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?

VANESSA: No, it’s okay.

JERRY: So, I guess you don’t find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?

VANESSA: Not especially.

JERRY: Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?

VANESSA: What can we do? It’s raining.

JERRY: We cold play “Sorry!” We cold play “Steal the Old Man’s Bundle.” (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that you’re wearing?

VANESSA: Oh, you’ve never heard of it.

JERRY: No, what? What kind is it?

VANESSA: I can’t tell you.

JERRY: (thinking) Yeah, that’s normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?

VANESSA: That stock? I thought you got out of that?

JERRY: I did. I’m just curious. It’s been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) It’s up six points!

VANESSA: I told you not to sell.

JERRY: You did not tell me not to sell.

VANESSA: I said the market fluctuates. Remember?

JERRY: Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!

VANESSA: That’s probably why we're-

(She stops herself.)

JERRY: What?

VANESSA: Forget it.

JERRY: No, what? ‘That’s probably why..’

VANESSA: That’s probably why we’re staying here, because you lost money on the stock.

JERRY: (thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(Jerry, George and Elaine are there, having just eaten.)

GEORGE: (laughing) Have something else. C’mon, have a little dessert?

JERRY : I’m good, thanks.

GEORGE: Elaine, get something! It’s all taken care of.

ELAINE: I’m kinda full.

GEORGE: So don’t finish it.

JERRY: (acidly) She’s full. So, Big Daddy. I’m just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?

GEORGE: I don’t like to discuss figures.

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: I don’t know, what? Eight thousand. It’s a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.

JERRY: So, Wilkinson’s out of the hospital now?

GEORGE : No. You’d be surprised. You don’t recover that quickly from a nose job.

(Elaine sneezes.)

ELAINE: Oh god.

JERRY: Is that still from the cats?

ELAINE: No, I just have a cold.

JERRY: So, what ever happened with that?

ELAINE: I gave him an ultimatum.

(Jerry looks at her. Elaine shrugs.)

GEORGE: He chose the cats?

ELAINE: They’re very clean animals.

JERRY: I gotta say, that’s pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.

ELAINE: Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.

GEORGE: I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can’t get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You’d get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...

ELAINE: Superman can go back in time?

JERRY: We went over that.

GEORGE: Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinson’s got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. They’re about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.

JERRY: A robot butcher?

GEORGE: Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there’s very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I’m not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I’ve decided I’ll do the work. I’m gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? ‘Cause you send your money out there – working for you – a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, “What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me.” “Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.”

JERRY: I’m always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, “Is this the best lane for me? For my life?” They’re always a little bit ahead of you, “Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?” “Yeah, come on over here, pal. We’re zoomin’ over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.” The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we’ll be going, (Jerry pretends he’s driving in reverse.) “Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. I’m gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.”



INT. JERRY’S CAR

(Jerry is in the driver’s seat, and George is in the passenger seat.)

GEORGE: She can’t kill me right?

JERRY: No, of course not.

GEORGE: People break up all the time.

JERRY: Everyday.

GEORGE: It just didn’t work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn’t.

JERRY: You tried.

GEORGE: I kept looking at her face. I’d go, “C’mon, love her. Love her!”

JERRY: Did you tell her you loved her?

GEORGE: Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She’d tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. I’d go, “Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, that’s, that’s something.” But, eventually you have to come back with, “Well, I love you.” You know, you can only hold out for so long.”

JERRY: You’re a human being.

GEORGE: And I didn’t even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I can’t do that to someone.

JERRY: You’re too nice a guy.

GEORGE: I am. I’m a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I’m sitting on the couch, she’s on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she’s on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn’t do that. I would’ve insulted her.

JERRY: You’re flesh and blood.

GEORGE: I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn’t want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. “This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father...” It’s like I’m in quicksand.

JERRY: I told you when I met her.

GEORGE: My back is killing me.

JERRY: You gotta go to my chiropractor, he’s the best.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, everybody’s guy is the best.

JERRY: I’m gonna make an appointment for you. We’ll go together.

GEORGE: Please. They don’t do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can’t I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.

JERRY: You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!

(Car door opens. It’s Elaine.)

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

(George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back.)

ELAINE: Hey, what are you doing?

GEORGE: I’m letting you in.

ELAINE: Oh no. No. I don’t want to sit in the back. I’ll be left out of the conversation.

GEORGE: No, you won’t.

ELAINE: Yes, I will, George. I’ll have to stick my chin on top of the seat.

GEORGE: Okay.

(George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the middle.)

ELAINE: Why can’t you sit in the middle?

GEORGE: Please, it doesn’t look good. Boy, boy, girl.

ELAINE: You’re afraid to sit next to a man. You’re a little homophobic, aren’t ya?

GEORGE: Is it that obvious?

(Elaine sits in the middle.)

ELAINE: Hello, Jerry.

JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: Did you get a haircut?

JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?

ELAINE: Tell me if you think this is strange. There’s this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He’s a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we’d run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He’s a nice guy, he’s got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that’s where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn’t nod. Like I don’t exist?! He went from nods to nothing.

GEORGE: (singing; imitating Tony Bennett) “You know, I’d go from nods to nothing...”

ELAINE: And now, there’s this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, it’s like we really hate each other. It’s based on nothing.

JERRY: A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in “The Blob”.

GEORGE: I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.

ELAINE: Really?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: You would do that?

GEORGE: If I was a different person.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is on the phone.)

JERRY: Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I’m sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...

(The other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials. Kramer enters. The intercom buzzes; Kramer answers it.)

KRAMER: (to the intercom) Come on up.

JERRY: (to the phone) Oh, it’s you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn’t have had to do this. Now that’s two long distance calls I made to you why can’t you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.

(Kramer holds up some cantaloupe.)

KRAMER: Taste this.

JERRY: No, I just had a sandwich.

KRAMER: No, taste it. Taste it.

JERRY: I don’t want cantaloupe now.

KRAMER: You’ve never had cantaloupe like this before...

JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...

KRAMER: ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.

JERRY: ...all right!

(Jerry tastes it.)

KRAMER: Uh-huh. It’s good?

JERRY: It’s very good.

KRAMER: Good, huh?

JERRY: Good.

KRAMER: I got it at Joe’s.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: Forty-nine cents a pound. That’s practically half than what you’re paying at the supermarket. I don’t know why you don’t go to Joe’s.

JERRY: It’s too far.

KRAMER: It’s three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..

JERRY: I’m not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll ‘em down below my knee?

KRAMER: See, the other thing is, if you don’t like anything, he takes it right back.

JERRY: I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.

(Enter George. He dances around the room, singing the Zorba theme.)

GEORGE: I’m outta there. I did it! It’s over.

JERRY: You did it? What happened?

GEORGE: I told her. In the kitchen – which was risky ‘cause it’s near all the knives. I started with the word “Listen.”

JERRY: Uh-huh...

GEORGE: I said, “Listen Marlene,” and then the next thing I know, I’m in the middle of it. And there’s this voice inside of me going, “You’re doing it! You’re doing it!” And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, “Keep going, keep going. You’re almost out!” It’s like I was making a prison break, you know, and I’m heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She’s firing at me from the guard tower. “Son of a bang! Son of a boom!” I get to the top of the wall – the front door. I opened it up, I’m one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!

JERRY: See, it’s never as bad as you imagine.

KRAMER: I liked Marlene. What’s her number?

GEORGE: Uh, no, I, I don’t think so.

(Kramer is eating cantaloupe.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?

KRAMER: George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.

GEORGE: Oh no, thank you.

KRAMER: It’s the best cantaloupe I ever had.

GEORGE: No, really. No, no, thanks.

KRAMER: Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.

JERRY: It’s very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So that’s it? You’re out?

GEORGE: Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.

JERRY: So, go get them.

GEORGE: Oh, no no, I can’t go back there. Jerry, it’s so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, I’d be right back where I started from.

JERRY: So forget about the books. Did you read them?

GEORGE: Well, yeah.

JERRY: What do you need them for?

GEORGE: I don’t know. They’re books.

JERRY: What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they’re trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?

GEORGE: They’re my books.

JERRY: So you want me to get the books? Is that it?



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(Jerry and Marlene are sitting at a booth. Marlene has a milkshake. A pile of books are on the table.)

MARLENE: ...so, it must’ve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone’s just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I don’t know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, “Marlene, just do it.” And I jumped in. And as I’m getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.

JERRY: So what’d you do?

MARLENE: Well, nothing. It’s no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn’t see what the big attraction was.

JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.

MARLENE: Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don’t see each other anymore, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stay friends.

JERRY: No.

MARLENE: Good enough. I’m really glad we got that settled.



INT. CHIROPRACTOR’S WAITING ROOM – DAY

(Jerry and George are reading magazines.)

JERRY: I don’t know how this happened.

GEORGE: Jerry, it’s not my fault.

JERRY: No, no. It’s not your fault. “Books, books, I need my books.” Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it’s not like Marlene’s a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we’ve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And it’s these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I’m busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she’s in the middle of a sentence!

GEORGE: It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?

JERRY: (disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes she’ll go, (imitates Marlene) “Hello, Jerry?” And I’ll go, “Oh, hi Marlene.” And then it’s “Jerry...”

JERRY & GEORGE: “I dunno sometimes...”

GEORGE: What trying to get off the phone?

JERRY: (more disgusted) Ohhhh! You can’t! It’s impossible! There’s no break in the conversation where you can go, “All right then...” You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.

GEORGE: Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Don’t you think?

JERRY: Yeah. Yes, she is.

(The RECEPTIONIST enters.)

RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah.

RECEPTIONIST: The doctor will see you now.

GEORGE: (to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I’m going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren’t I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctor’s office.) “Oh, hello, Doctor.”



INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. ‘Cause it says “Waiting Room.” There’s no chance of not waiting. ‘Cause they call it the waiting room, they’re gonna use it. They’ve got it. It’s all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you’ve got your little magazine. You pretend you’re reading it, but you’re really looking at the other people. You know, you’re thinking about about them. Things like, “I wonder what he’s got. As soon as she goes, I’m getting her magazine.” And then, they finally call you and it’s a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen. I’ll see you all later.” You know, so you think you’re going to see the doctor, but you’re not, are you? No. You’re going into the next waiting room – the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don’t wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don’t want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, “I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in?” Do they scalp tickets to these things? “I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...”



INT. CHIROPRACTOR’S WAITING ROOM – DAY

(George returns from his appointment to meet Jerry.)

JERRY: So, how was it?

GEORGE: I was in there for two minutes. He didn’t do anything. Touch this, feel that – seventy-five bucks!

JERRY: Well, it’s a first visit.

GEORGE: What’s seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I don’t understand this. I’m only paying half.

JERRY: You can’t do that.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: He’s a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.

GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.



INT. JERRY’S CAR – NIGHT

(Jerry is dropping off Marlene.)

MARLENE: Are you feeling weird?

JERRY: No, I’m fine.

MARLENE: Nothing really happened.

JERRY: Yeah, I know.

MARLENE: We just kissed a little. People kiss.

JERRY: Yeah.

MARLENE: Well... night.

(She leans over and kisses Jerry on the cheek. She exits the car. Jerry is stunned.)

JERRY: (belated) Good night.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Kramer enters with a golf club.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I got it! This time, I got it!

JERRY : All right.

(Kramer sets up to show his golf swing.)

KRAMER: Hips! See, it’s all hips.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: You gotta come through with the hips first.

(He swings at an imaginary golf ball. Jerry looks off into the distance, at the ball.)

JERRY: That is out there.

(Kramer notices Jerry is eating cantaloupe; his eyes light up.)

KRAMER: Joe’s?

JERRY: No, supermarket.

KRAMER: Well, is it good?

JERRY: It’s uh okay.

KRAMER: Let me taste it.

(He takes a bite and immediately spits it out.)

KRAMER: See, that stinks. You can’t eat that. You should take that back.

JERRY: I’m not taking it back.

KRAMER: All right, I’ll take it back. I’m going by there.

JERRY: I don’t care about it.

KRAMER: Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.

JERRY: All right. Take it back.

(Jerry’s phone rings. He is reluctant to answer it. The machine picks up.)

JERRY’S MESSAGE: “Leave a message, I’ll call you back.”

MARLENE: (from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I’m not talking into the soap right now, call me back.

KRAMER: Well?

JERRY: Marlene.

KRAMER: (smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...

JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night – we kinda started up a little bit in the car.

KRAMER: I thought you were trying to get rid of her?

JERRY: I was. But, she’s got me, like, hypnotized.

KRAMER: Does George know?

JERRY: No, he’d go nuts.

KRAMER: Yeah, no kidding.

JERRY: I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, I’ve seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can’t go any further, but... She’s just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can’t breathe. It’s like a drug.

KRAMER: Whoa, psychosexual.

JERRY: I don’t know how I’m going to tell him.

KRAMER: Man, I don’t understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?

JERRY: It’s partially you, yeah.

KRAMER: You’re his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn’t even know?

JERRY: Well, he can’t kill me, right?

KRAMER: You’re a human being.

JERRY: I mean, she called me. I haven’t called her. She started it.

KRAMER: You’re flesh and blood.

JERRY: I’m a nice guy.

(Elaine enters, holding a desk lamp in the shape of an airplane.)

ELAINE: Hi.

(She hands Jerry the lamp.)

JERRY: (excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.

ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. That’s hard to get used to when you’re in so many other fast ones.

JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don’t have to be home on time.

ELAINE: Unless you’re married to a dictator.

JERRY: Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.

ELAINE: Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebody’s going to offer me some cantaloupe?

KRAMER: Nope. No good.

JERRY: Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.

KRAMER: Well, I’m taking this back.

(Kramer exits.)

ELAINE: So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.

JERRY: Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: You talked to him?

ELAINE: Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, “No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.”

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, “Hi, remember me?” And he furrows his brow, as if he’s really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, “You little phony. You know exactly who I am.”

JERRY: You said "you little phony"?

ELAINE: I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, “Oh, yeah. You’re Jeanette’s friend. We did meet once.” And I said, “Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?”

JERRY: This is amazing.

ELAINE: And he says, he says, “Look, I just didn’t want to say hello anymore, All right?” And I said, “Fine. Fine. I didn’t want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I’m aware of it!”

(Elaine tastes some cantaloupe.)

JERRY: You are the Queen of Confrontation. You’re my new hero. In fact, you’ve inspired me. I’m gonna call George about something right now.

ELAINE: This cantaloupe stinks.

(She spits it out in a napkin.)



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a table for two.)

GEORGE: (considers for a second) I don’t care.

JERRY: You’re kidding.

GEORGE: No, I don’t care.

JERRY: You mean that?

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: You don’t care?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: How could you not care?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But I don’t. I’m actually almost happy to hear it.

JERRY: I thought you’d be upset.

GEORGE: I guess I should be, but I’m not.

JERRY: Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?

GEORGE: You’re a fine person. You’re a humanitarian. She’s very sexy.

JERRY: That voice. That voice. She’s driving me crazy.

GEORGE: I know. I know.

JERRY: So I can see her tonight, and you don’t care?

GEORGE: See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She’s too crazy for me.

JERRY: All right. As long as you’re okay. Because I can’t stop thinking about her.

GEORGE: I’m okay. I’m fine. I’m wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.

JERRY: Good. And I’ll tell you what... You don’t have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.

GEORGE: (shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!

JERRY: I had to.

GEORGE: He didn’t do anything, Jerry. It’s a scam! Who told you to do that?

JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.

GEORGE: Oh, I was trying to make a point.

JERRY: Why don’t you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) What’s wrong?

GEORGE: (gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!



INT. JERRY’S CAR – NIGHT

(Jerry and Marlene are parked outside Jerry’s building.)

JERRY: So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?

MARLENE: I’m sorry, Jerry. I just don’t think this is gonna work.

JERRY: Really? I thought...

MARLENE: I know, I’m sorry.

JERRY: Gee, I just didn’t expect it from the way you’ve been acting.

MARLENE: You sure you want to talk about this? ‘Cause I sure don’t.

JERRY: Of course I want to talk about it.

MARLENE: Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.

JERRY: Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?

MARLENE: I saw your act.

JERRY: My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?

MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didn’t make it for me. It’s just so much fluff.

JERRY: I can’t believe this. So what are you saying? You didn’t like my act, so that’s it?

MARLENE: I can’t be with someone if I don’t respect what they do.

JERRY: You’re a cashier!

MARLENE: Look, Jerry, it’s just wasn't my kind of humor.

JERRY: You can’t go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.

MARLENE: I heard the material.

JERRY: I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Women need to like the job of the guy they’re with. If they don’t like the job, they don’t like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. “Well, right now, I’m the regional management supervisor. I’m in development, research, consulting...” Men on the other hand – if they are physically attracted to a woman – are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don’t really care. Men’ll just go, “Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? You’re just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don’t you shower up, and we’ll get some burgers and catch a movie.”

JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn’t want to move to Florida, but they’re in their sixties, and that’s the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people’s house with a golf cart, jump out, “Let’s go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it!” I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation’s so boring. It’s so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, “What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass.” You know. Come back in, there’s broken glass, everybody’s all upset. “No, I’m all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, I’m fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let’s pick it up right there.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry’s father, Morty, is watching television. His mother, Helen, is ironing his father’s jacket.)

HELEN: You have so many nice jackets. I don’t know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What’s wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can’t wear this!

(Jerry’s phone rings. Helen goes into the bathroom)

MORTY: Are you getting that?

HELEN: I thought you were getting it.

MORTY: Should I pick up?

HELEN: You want me to get that?

MORTY: I’ll get it!

HELEN: I’ll get it!

(They both go for the phone; Helen gets to it first.)

HELEN: Hello?... Hello?

(She hangs up. Jerry enters, wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove.)

JERRY: Hi.

HELEN: Hi.

JERRY: (to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!

(Jerry picks up the remote and turns off the TV.)

MORTY: So, how’d you do?

JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We’ll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.

HELEN: This is your greatest moment? A game?

JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.

MORTY: You know what my greatest moment was, don’t you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.

HELEN: Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?

JERRY: Well, the man’s an individualist – he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he’s doing.

HELEN: But it’s their 50th anniversary.

MORTY: Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.

HELEN: You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.

JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.

HELEN: So bring her.

JERRY: I don’t even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I’ve met them three times in my life.

MORTY: I don’t know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.

HELEN: At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you’ll leave.

MORTY: How come he gets to leave?

JERRY: If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He’s always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it’s because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.

MORTY: And it’s always about Jeffrey, right?

JERRY: Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.

(Enter Kramer.)

KRAMER: Morty, are you coming in?

MORTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey, how’d you do?

JERRY: We won. We’re in the finals on Wednesday.

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: (to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?

KRAMER: I’m completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You’re not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Levels.

JERRY: Levels?

KRAMER: Yeah, I’m getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I’m going to build these different levels, with steps, and it’ll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.

JERRY: You drew up plans for this?

KRAMER: No no. It’s all in my head.

MORTY: I don’t know how you’re going to be comfortable like that.

KRAMER: Oh, I’ll be comfortable.

JERRY: When do you intend to do this?

KRAMER: Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.

JERRY: You’re doing this yourself?

KRAMER: It’s a simple job. Why, you don’t think I can?

JERRY: Oh, no. It’s not that I don’t think you can. I know that you can’t, and I’m positive that you won’t.

KRAMER: Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.

MORTY: Hey, that’s some big job.

JERRY: I, don’t see it happening.

KRAMER: Well, this time, this time you’re wrong. C’mon. I’ll even bet you.

JERRY: Seriously?

HELEN: I don’t want you betting. Morty, don’t let him bet.

KRAMER: A big dinner with dessert. But I’ve got till the end of the month.

JERRY: I’ll give you a year.

KRAMER: No no no. End of the month.

JERRY: It’s a bet.

(They “pinkie swear” to lock the deal.)



INT. MANYA & ISAAC’S APARTMENT – EVENING

(Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Elaine is sitting at the kiddie table, lower than everyone else. Helen and Morty sit across from Jerry. Manya and Isaac sit at the head of the table. Other guests are present as well.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?

ELAINE: No, no. I’m fine.

(Uncle Leo grabs Jerry’s arm.)

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, are you listening to this?

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.

UNCLE LEO: So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.

JERRY: Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?

UNCLE LEO: No, for the walking tours.

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.

UNCLE LEO: That’s exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he’s talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?

JERRY: Mickey Mantle?

(Uncle Leo is confused by this comment.)

ELAINE: (saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!

JERRY: (eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.

ELAINE: Mmm... phenomenal peas.

MORTY: Are you ready for dessert?

JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.

MANYA: (surprised) You’re going?

ELAINE: Oh uh, I don’t really eat dessert. I’m dieting.

JERRY: Yeah, I can’t eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can’t dance.

MANYA : Can’t dance?

HELEN: He’s kidding, Manya.

MANYA: Is that a joke?

HELEN: So, did you hear Claire’s getting married?

MANYA: Yeah, yeah..

HELEN: I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.

JERRY: Horses? They’re like big riding dogs.

ELAINE: What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...

JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.

MANYA: (angry) I had a pony.

(The room goes dead quiet.)

JERRY: Well, I didn’t uh really mean a pony, per se...

MANYA: When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, what’s wrong with that?

JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...

HELEN: Should we have coffee? Who’s having coffee?

MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.

JERRY: Well, I’m sure you did. Who wouldn’t love a pony? Who wouldn’t love a person that had a pony?

MANYA: You! You said so!

JERRY: No, see, we didn’t have ponies. I’m sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..

MANYA: That’s it! I had enough!

(Manya gets up from the table and exits.)

ISAAC: Have your coffee, everybody. She’s a little upset. It’s been an emotional day.

(Isaac exits. Everyone looks at Jerry.)

JERRY: I didn’t know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant’s going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin’ on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn’t make sense. Am I wrong?



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Morty and Helen are collecting their luggage.)

JERRY: I’ll drive you to the airport.

HELEN: No, we’re taking a cab.

JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didn’t put a damper on the trip.

HELEN: Don’t be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.

MORTY: Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.

JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I’m sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.

HELEN: You know, you should give Manya a call.

JERRY: Maybe I will.

(Jerry opens his door. Kramer is standing in the hallway.)

KRAMER: Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.

(He points to the bags.)

KRAMER: Need any help with those?

MORTY: It’s nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?

KRAMER: Oh, well... I decided I’m not gonna do it.

JERRY: (laughing) Really? What a shock.

HELEN: Goodbye, Jerry.

JERRY: Take care.

HELEN: We’ll call you.

(Helen exits.)

MORTY: Bye, Jer.

JERRY: Bye, Dad. Take it easy.

MORTY: Bye, Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah. So long, Morty.

(Morty leaves. Jerry closes the door. He and Kramer enter the kitchen. )

JERRY: So, when do I get my dinner?

KRAMER: There’s no dinner. The bet’s off. I’m not gonna do it.

JERRY: Yes, I know you’re not gonna do it. That’s why I bet.

KRAMER: Ya well, there’s no bet if I’m not doing it.

JERRY: That’s the bet! That you’re not doing it!

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I could do it. I don’t wanna do it.

JERRY: We didn’t bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.

KRAMER: And it could be done.

JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it’s done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!

KRAMER: I don’t want the levels!

JERRY: That’s the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch ‘em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Don’t get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – LATER

(Helen and Morty are back with Jerry.)

HELEN: Who did you talk to?

JERRY: Uncle Leo.

HELEN: And when’s the funeral?

JERRY: I don’t know. He said he’d call back.

MORTY: You know what this means, don’t you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.

HELEN: She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...

JERRY: What?

HELEN: What? Nothing.

JERRY: You don’t think... What? The pony remark?

HELEN: Oh, don’t be ridiculous. She was an old woman.

JERRY: You don’t think that I killed her?

MORTY: You know what the flight back’ll cost us?

JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! I didn’t know she had a pony!

MORTY: Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.

JERRY: The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) That’s probably Uncle Leo.

(Helen picks up.)

HELEN: Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, it’s just one of those things... Sure, sure, we’ll see you then.

(She hangs up.)

HELEN: The funeral’s Wednesday.

JERRY: Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?

HELEN: Two o’ clock, Wednesday.

JERRY: Ah

(Helen looks at Jerry.)

HELEN: What?

JERRY: I’ve got the softball game on Wednesday. It’s the championship.

HELEN: So? You’re not obligated. Go play in your game.

JERRY: I didn’t even know the woman.

HELEN: So don’t go.

JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I don’t even know her last name.

HELEN: Jerry, no one’s forcing you.

JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That’s what I want to know. I mean, it’s the championship, I’m hitting everything.

HELEN: I don’t have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You don’t have anything.

MORTY: I got my sport jacket.

HELEN: You’re not wearing that to a funeral.

MORTY: What’s wrong with it?

HELEN: It looks ridiculous.

MORTY: What? I’m gonna buy a new sport jacket now?

JERRY: I don’t know what to do.

MORTY: (depressed) You know what this funeral’s gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: We don’t understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can’t stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don’t see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let’s make up our mind where we think they’re going.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Elaine and Jerry sit across from George at a booth.)

ELAINE: I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time’s your game?

JERRY: Two Forty-Five.

ELAINE: And what time’s the funeral?

JERRY: Two o’ clock.

ELAINE: How long does a funeral take?

JERRY: Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.

ELAINE: So you can’t do both?

JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn’t expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.

ELAINE: How can you even consider not going?

GEORGE: You know, I’ve been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I’ll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How’s it gonna happen? I just don’t see how it could occur.

ELAINE: You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I’m actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.

GEORGE: They always make me take stock of my life. And how I’ve pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.

JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, “From this moment on, I’m not gonna waste any more of it.” But then you go, “How? What can I do that’s not wasting it?”

ELAINE: Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can’t you have coffee with people?

GEORGE: You know, I can’t believe you’re even considering not playing. We need you. You’re hitting everything.

ELAINE: He has to go. He may have killed her.

JERRY: Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, but I didn’t say I hated anyone who had one.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Who’s going to play left field?

JERRY: Bender.

GEORGE: Bender? He can’t play left. He stinks. I just don’t see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who’s at their funeral? They don’t even know they’re having a funeral. It’s not like she’s hanging out in the back going, “I can’t believe Jerry didn’t show up.”

ELAINE: Maybe she’s there in spirit. How about that?

GEORGE: If you’re a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she’s gonna wanna hang around Drexler’s funeral home on Ocean Parkway?

ELAINE: George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.

GEORGE: You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It’s not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) It’s all mental.

JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now he’s moving to Pheonix.

ELAINE: Phoenix? What’s happening with his appartment?

JERRY: I don’t know. They’ve been in there since, like, World War II. The rent’s three hundred a month.

ELAINE: Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.



INT. FUNERAL HOME – DAY

(The eulogy is in progress. Jerry is in attendance.)

EULOGIST: Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world – a simpler world – with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It’s lustrous coat, it’s flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.

(Jerry sinks in his seat.)



INT. FUNERAL HOME – LATER

(Jerry and Elaine are talking to Helen. Jerry checks his watch.)

JERRY: Well, the game’s starting just about now.

HELEN: It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.

(Morty is talking to his NEPHEW on the other side of the room.)

NEPHEW: I’m not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I’m just an intern. I can’t write a note to an airline.

MORTY: You’ve got your degree. They don’t care. They just want to see something.

(Jerry is talking to Isaac.)

JERRY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was...

(Uncle Leo interrupts.)

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They’re transferring him to Riverside - so he’ll completely revamp that operation, you understand?

JERRY: Yeah.

UNCLE LEO: He’ll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, that’s your cousin.

(Morty is still talking to his nephew.)

MORTY: You don’t understand, I’ve never paid a full fare.

(Jerry and Elaine talk to Isaac.)

JERRY: Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.

ELAINE: Oh, me too.

ISAAC: Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad.

ELAINE: So, I understand you’re moving to Phoenix?

(Jerry shakes his head and walks away.)

ISAAC: Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would’ve liked Phoenix.

ELAINE: Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, what’s happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: Of course it’s very hot there. I’ll have to get uh air conditioner.

ELAINE: Oh, you can have mine. I’ll ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?

ISAAC: Although they say it’s a dry heat.

ELAINE: Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) what’s happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: I don’t even know if I should take my winter clothing.

ELAINE: I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I’ll watch it for you and I’ll live there and I’ll make sure that nothing happens to it.

(Jerry returns.)

ISAAC: Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey’s taking the apartment.

ELAINE: Oh, Jeffrey.

JERRY: You know Jeffery?

ELAINE : Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.

(Helen approaches Jerry.)

HELEN: It’s raining.

(Jerry goes to the window.)

JERRY: It’s raining? It’s raining. The game will be postponed. We’ll play tomorrow.

(Back to Morty and his nephew.)

MORTY: Believe me, I wouldn’t bother you if the army hadn’t closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.

NEPHEW: I can’t. I’ll get in trouble.

MORTY: Oh, for God’s sake!



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George, Jerry and Elaine are sitting at a table. Jerry and George are wearing baseball uniforms.)

GEORGE: Who gets picked off in softball? It’s unheard of.

JERRY: It’s never happened to me before.

ELAINE: I remember saying to myself, “Why is Jerry so far off the base?”

JERRY: I’ll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.

(George consults his stat sheet of the game.)

GEORGE: And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?

JERRY: I thought there were two outs.

ELAINE: I couldn’t believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.

JERRY : It was the single worst moment of my life.

GEORGE: (smiling) What about Sharon Besser?

JERRY: Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.

ELAINE: Makes you wonder, though, doesn’t it?

JERRY: Wonder about what?

ELAINE: You know... (looking up) the spirit world.

JERRY: You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?

ELAINE: I never saw anyone play like that.

JERRY: But I went to the funeral.

ELAINE: Yeah, but that doesn’t make up for killin’ her.

GEORGE: Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.

JERRY: Don’t you think she woulda heard I was there?

GEORGE: Not necessarily.

(Pause.)

JERRY: Who figures and immigrant’s gonna have a pony?

(Elaine laughs)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don’t use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like he’s riding a pony.) “Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I’m talking to you. Behind the barricades!” So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn’t it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... “Baltic, that’s two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, that’s it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.”

JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can’t stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won’t even exist. It won’t. I think eventually we’ll all be wearing the same thing. ‘Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there’s people from the future or another planet, they’re all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, “This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. That’s it.” We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, “That was nice. I could wear that.”



INT. CLOTHING STORE

(Jerry is talking to a SALESMAN. Elaine is also there, holding a book.)

JERRY : I think I’ve seen enough.

SALESMAN: Well, I might have something in the back.

(Salesman exits.)

ELAINE: The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they’d put it out in the front.

JERRY: Why don’t they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, “Just Back.” All back; No front. You walk in the front, you’re immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.

(Elaine laughs. A CUSTOMER approaches, and notices the book Elaine is holding.)

CUSTOMER: Oh, I just read that. That’s terrific.

JERRY: (pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.

CUSTOMER: Alton Benes is your father?

ELAINE: Yeah.

CUSTOMER: I always felt he deserved a wider audience.

ELAINE: I’m not so sure he wants one.

(Customer exits.)

ELAINE: Hey, don’t forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o’clock.

JERRY: I guess I’m coming. I mean...

ELAINE: What? What, you don’t want to go now?

JERRY: No, I’ll go. I’m going.

ELAINE: No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven’t seen my father in a while and... you know...

JERRY: I’m worried I won’t be able to talk to him. He’s such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.

ELAINE: So, that’s why we’re not together anymore.

(Jerry pulls the invisible dagger Elaine just stabbed him with, out of his back. A jacket on a rack catches his eye.)

JERRY: What is this?

(He takes the jacket off the rack.)

JERRY: This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.

ELAINE: Try it on.

(Jerry puts on the jacket. Elaine feels the material.)

ELAINE: Wow, this is soft suede.

JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.

(Elaine grabs the tag.)

JERRY: How much is it?

ELAINE: (shocked) Oh my God.

JERRY: Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?

ELAINE: You have no idea.

JERRY: I have some idea.

ELAINE: No idea.

JERRY: I’ve got a ballpark.

ELAINE: There is no park and the team has relocated.

JERRY: Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.

ELAINE: Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.

(Jerry opens up the jacket and looks at the lining.)

JERRY: What’s with the pink lining and the candy stripes?

ELAINE: Well, it’s just a lining. You can always have it changed.

JERRY: Should I get it? I hate these moments. I’m hearing the dual voices now, you know, “What about the money?” “What’s money?”

(The salesman returns from the back.)

SALESMAN: It looks wonderful on you.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – MORNING

(Jerry is sitting on his couch wearing his new jacket over his pyjamas. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters.)

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey. New jacket?

JERRY: What do you think?

KRAMER: It’s beautiful.

JERRY: Is it me?

KRAMER: That’s definitely you.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: That’s more you than you’ve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?

JERRY: I don’t know. It’s got a pink lining.

KRAMER: Oh... So, what did you pay for this?

JERRY : I paid what it costs.

KRAMER: How much?

JERRY: What’s the difference?

KRAMER: What, you’re not gonna tell me?

JERRY: I’d rather not say it out loud. It’s embarrassing.

KRAMER: Over three hundred?

JERRY: Yes, but let’s just stop it right there.

KRAMER: It’s over four hundred?

JERRY : Really, I’m not answering anymore.

KRAMER: Is it over four hundred?

JERRY: Would you?

(Kramer finds the tag hanging off the mirror.)

KRAMER: Woah, Nelson!

JERRY: I know, I know.

(Kramer walks over to Jerry’s old jacket, hanging by the door.)

KRAMER: What are you gonna do with the leather one?

JERRY: I don’t know.

KRAMER: Well, are you gonna wear it?

JERRY: Maybe.

KRAMER: You’re not going to wear this.

JERRY: Do you want it?

KRAMER: Well, yeah. Okay. I’ll take it. I like the jacket.

(Jerry considers giving up the leather jacket.)

JERRY: Okay, take it.

KRAMER: Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerry’s old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is sitting on the couch. George enters.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...”

JERRY: What is that song?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I’m singin’ it on elevators, buses. I’m singin’ it in front of clients. It’s taken over my life.

JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that.

GEORGE: Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?

JERRY: No, you idiot.

GEORGE: What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin’ me an idiot?

JERRY: You don’t know Robert Schumann? The composer?

GEORGE: Oh, Schumann. Of course.

JERRY: He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.

GEORGE: Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesn’t stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Let’s just go, All right? I can’t believe we’re having dinner with Alton Benes.

JERRY: I know exactly what’s gonna happen tonight. I’m gonna try and act like I’m not impressed, he’s gonna see right through it.

GEORGE: Yeah, he’ll be looking at us like he’s backstage at a puppet show.

JERRY: Let me just get my jacket.

(Jerry enters the bedroom.)

GEORGE: (singing) : “Master of the house/Keeper of the inn...” (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?

JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it’s with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might’ve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.

GEORGE: Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.

JERRY: Absolutely.

GEORGE: It’s fabulous.

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: And I’ll tell you something else, I’m not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I’m not gonna ask. You’ll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores George’s questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Can’t be seven. Don’t tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you’re saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I won’t say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) I’m walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! I’ll tell you what, if you don’t say anything in the next five seconds, I’ll know it was over a thousand.

(George gets ready with his watch. Enter Kramer.)

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?

JERRY: Well, what kind of solid?

KRAMER: I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it’s double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.

JERRY: Birds?

KRAMER: Yeah. A friend of mine, he’s a magician. He’s going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.

JERRY: So take a cab.

KRAMER: They won’t take a cage full of birds.

JERRY: I can’t. I’m on my way out. There’s no way I can do it.

KRAMER: George, do me a solid? Two minutes.

GEORGE: Well, I’m going with him. I’d like to... I’ve never done a ‘solid’ before.

KRAMER: All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.

(Kramer leaves.)

JERRY: (scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S LOBBY – NIGHT

(Jerry and George enter.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...”

(Jerry points to his head with a “crazy” gesture.)

JERRY: Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?

GEORGE: Maybe he didn’t show up.

(George starts to leave the hotel.)

JERRY: What, you don’t want to do this?

GEORGE: I don’t think there’s ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?

JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Where’s Elaine?

GEORGE: I’m nervous.

JERRY: (to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yeah?

JERRY: I’m Jerry, Elaine’s friend, and this is George.

(George offers his hand to Alton.)

GEORGE: It’s a great thrill to meet you, Sir.

(Alton starts hacking. George withdraws his hand. Alton gestures to a couch beside the leather chair.)

ALTON: Sit down. Want a drink?

(Jerry and George sit.)

JERRY: Sure.

(Alton summons the waiter, who approaches.)

ALTON: What’ll you have?

JERRY: (to waiter) I’ll have a cranberry juice with two limes.

GEORGE: And, I’ll have a club soda with no ice.

BENES: I’ll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.

(The waiter exits.)

GEORGE: You like ice?

ALTON: Huh?

GEORGE: I said, do you like ice?

ALTON: Like it?

GEORGE: Don’t you think you get more without it?

ALTON: Where’s Elaine?

JERRY: Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She’s usually pretty punctual. Don’t you find that, George?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She’s punctual... and uh she’s been late, sometimes.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she’s on time, and... sometimes she’s late.

GEORGE: I guess... (chuckles) today she’s late.

JERRY: It appears that way.

GEORGE: Yup.

JERRY: Yup.

(Jerry and George look at the door, anticipating Elaine’s arrival.)

ALTON: Looks like rain.

GEORGE: I know, I know, that’s what they said.

ALTON: Who said?

GEORGE: The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

ALTON: I don’t need anybody to tell me it’s gonna rain.

GEORGE: No, of course not. I didn’t-

ALTON: All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (The waiter returns with the drinks, and distributes them to the men.) Which one’s suppose to be the funny guy?

GEORGE: (pointing at Jerry) Oh, he’s the comedian.

JERRY: I’m just a regular person.

GEORGE: No, no. He’s just being modest.

ALTON: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that.

(Jerry and George turn to the door again. Pause. Jerry gets up.)

JERRY: Would you excuse me a minute? I’m gonna go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.

(George holds on to Jerry’s jacket, but he pulls away and exits. George is alone with Alton.)

GEORGE: I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.

ALTON: Drivel.

GEORGE: Yea, well, maybe some parts.

ALTON: (defensive) What parts?

GEORGE: The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized – I have to make a phone call. I-I can’t believe- Would you-

(George leaves.)



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S BATHROOM – CONTINUING

(Jerry is washing his face. George enters.)

GEORGE: Thank you for leaving me alone with him!

JERRY: That was brutal. I can’t go back out there.

GEORGE: Well, let’s just leave.

JERRY: Elaine’ll kill me.

GEORGE: Where is she?

JERRY: She’s gotta be here soon.

GEORGE: How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that’s it! I’m leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.

JERRY: The waiter was trembling!

GEORGE: If she doesn’t show up, we can’t possibly have dinner with him alone.

JERRY: How are we gonna get out of it?

GEORGE: We’ll say we’re frightened and we have to go home.

JERRY: Yeah, that’s good. He’d clunk our heads together like Moe.

GEORGE: I don’t know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He’ll understand that.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: All fathers are intimidating. They’re intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, “To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I’ll eat whatever I want, I’ll wear whatever I want, and I’ll create whoever I want.”



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S LOBBY – NIGHT

(Jerry and George return from the bathroom.)

ALTON: (to George) Who’d you call?

GEORGE: (improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.

ALTON: What kind of operation?

GEORGE: Bone marrow.

(The hotel’s MANAGER approaches.)

MANAGER: Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yes?

MANAGER: A message for you.

(The manager hands him a message written on a piece of paper. Alton reads it to himself.)

ALTON: From Elaine. She got tied up. She’ll be here in thirty minutes.

(Jerry and George freeze.)



INT. HOTEL LOBBY – LATER

(Alton is in the middle of a rant.)

ALTON: Yeah, they should’ve taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in ‘fifty-three.

JERRY: Well, Guatamala...

GEORGE: Sure, Guatamala...

(Alton gets up.)

ALTON: All right, you boys get yourselves together. We’ll head up to the restaurant. I’ll leave a note for Elaine. I’m going to the bathroom.

(Alton exits.)

GEORGE: Come on, let’s go!

JERRY: What about Elaine?

GEORGE: To hell with Elaine!

JERRY: She’ll be furious.

GEORGE: We’re dying here!

(Elaine enters.)

JERRY: That’s her! She’s here!

ELAINE: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Where is Dad?

GEORGE: (contemptuously, imitating Alton’s voice) He’s in the bathroom.

JERRY: (to Elaine) Where have you been?!

ELAINE: Kramer! That... Kramer! I’m just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...

JERRY: Oh, you didn’t...

ELAINE: Well, he said he’d drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesn’t come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He’s a city marshal. He’s towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, we’re wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we’re running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Alton’s chair and takes a deep breath.) So how’s everything going over here?

JERRY: Great.

GEORGE: Couldn’t be better.

ELAINE: Good. ‘Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.

JERRY: Oh, no, no.

GEORGE: Get outta here..

ELAINE: Man, Kramer! I could kill him!

JERRY: I can’t believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.

ELAINE : He said he’d give me a lift.

JERRY: Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren’s song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?

GEORGE: Where do you come up with this stuff?

(Alton returns.)

ALTON: Well, look who’s here.

ELAINE: Oh, hi, Dad.

ALTON: Hello, dear.

(Alton kisses Elaine.)

ALTON: Who’s the lipstick for?

ELAINE: No one.

ALTON: How’s your mother?

ELAINE: Fine.

ALTON: How about you? Are you working?

ELAINE: Yeah, I’m reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.

ALTON: Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right, boys. We’ll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You’re not afraid of a little spice, are you?

(They all head for the door. Jerry and George trail behind a little.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...”

ALTON: Pipe down, chorus boy.

(Alton glares; George gets embarrassed. Elaine looks out the window.)

ELAINE: Ohh... it’s snowing. It’s beautiful.

JERRY: (to George) Snow. Snow, that can’t be good for suede, can it?

GEORGE: I wouldn’t think so.

JERRY: What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, we’re taking a cab, aren’t we?

ALTON: Cab? It’s only five blocks.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Why don’t you just turn it inside out?

JERRY: Inside out! Great.

(Jerry turns his jacket inside out, exposing the pink stripes. Alton stops him before Jerry can leave the hotel.)

ALTON: Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?

JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.

ALTON: Well, you look like a damn fool!

JERRY: Well, it’s a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.

ALTON: Well, you’re not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. That’s for damn sure.

(Jerry looks to George.)

GEORGE: It’s uh, it's only a few blocks.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is heading out. The intercom buzzes. Jerry presses the first button.)

JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I’ve gotta feed the birds.

JERRY: So?

KRAMER: You got any of those mini Ritzes?

(Jerry reaches up, and pulls some mini Ritzes from atop his refrigerator. He examines the box.)

JERRY: I can’t believe I do.

KRAMER: Yeah! Well, are you going out?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Hey, where’s your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. It’s ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?

JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.

KRAMER: Don’t you know what that does to suede?

JERRY: I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.

ELAINE: Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.

JERRY: Is he still in town?

ELAINE: No, he’s driving back to Maryland tonight.

(Kramer is holding a sleeve of the suede jacket.)

KRAMER: So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?

JERRY: I don’t know.

KRAMER: (smiling) Well...

ELAINE: (to Jerry) I didn’t want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: You gonna throw this out?

JERRY: Well, I can’t wear it.

ELAINE: Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Well, if you’re just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.

JERRY: Yeah, go ahead, take it.

ELAINE: Dad thinks George is gay.

JERRY: Oh, because of all the singing?

ELAINE: No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.

(Kramer returns from the bathroom, wearing the ruined suede jacket.)

KRAMER: Hey, see, I like it like this.

(Elaine points at the jacket Kramer is wearing.)

ELAINE: Isn’t that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you should’ve done? You should’ve turned it inside out.

JERRY: I’ll try and remember that.

(Kramer is holding Jerry’s old leather jacket.)

KRAMER: Boy, it’s too bad you gave me this one too.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad.

(Kramer opens up the suede jacket.)

KRAMER: I’m gonna have to do something about this lining.

(Kramer exits.)



INT. ALTON’S CAR – NIGHT

(Alton is driving home.)

ALTON: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...”



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don’t get this. Aren’t cows outside most of the time? I don’t understand it. When it’s raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, “Let us in, we’re all wearin’ leather. Open the door! We’re gonna ruin the whole outfit here!” “Is it suede?” “I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can’t have this cleaned. It’s all I got!” 

JERRY: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you’re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? “We have soda, we have soda, we have soda”, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It’s a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and you’re watching TV and you’re drinking the exact same product that they’re advertising right there on TV, and it’s like, you know, they’re spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and I’m standing there, “Maybe I’m putting too much ice in mine.”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George and Jerry enter.)

GEORGE: (excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn’t sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don’t know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they’re psychotic or something and I don’t know if I’m supposed to smile back, I don’t know what to do. So I just stood there like – remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That’s what I looked like.

JERRY: So you didn’t ask?

GEORGE: No, I froze.

(Jerry points to the coffee shop’s counter.)

JERRY: Counter.

(Jerry and George sit down at the counter.)

GEORGE: Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I’m back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, “So why don’t you call her?” I says, “I can’t.” I couldn’t, I couldn’t do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.

JERRY: He said wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.

JERRY: So you called.

GEORGE: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.

JERRY: Yeah. Like a farm boy.

GEORGE: Right. So I call her up, I tell her it’s me, she gives me an enthusiastic ‘Hi!’

JERRY: Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That’s beautiful.

GEORGE: Oh, I don’t get the enthusiastic hi, I’m outta there.

JERRY: All right, so you’re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.

GEORGE: So, we’re talking, and I don’t like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, “What are you doing Saturday night?”

JERRY: And?

GEORGE: She bought.

JERRY: Great day in the morning.

GEORGE: Then I got off the phone right away.

JERRY: Sure, it’s like robbing a bank. You don’t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.

GEORGE: It’s amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can’t remember the last time that happened.



INT. GEORGE’S CAR – SATURDAY NIGHT

(George and his date, Carol, are parked outside Carol’s building.)

GEORGE: I can’t stand doing laundry. That’s why I have forty pairs of underwear.

CAROL: You do not.

GEORGE: Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.

(They both laugh.)



INT. JERRY’S CAR – SATURDAY NIGHT

(Jerry and his date, DONNA are parked outside Donna’s building.)

JERRY: (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.

DONNA: That’s Irish.

JERRY: Irish, Scottish, what’s the difference, lassie?

(Donna laughs.)



INT. GEORGE’S CAR – CONTINUED

CAROL: So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.

GEORGE: Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.

CAROL: Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?

GEORGE: Oh, no, thanks. I can’t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.

CAROL: (confused by his response) So, um, okay.

GEORGE: Okay.

CAROL: Goodnight.

GEORGE: Yeah, take it easy.

(Carol exits the car. George realizes what he has done and slaps his forehead in disgust.)



INT. JERRY’S CAR – CONTINUED

DONNA: Thanks again for the movie.

JERRY: You’re welcome.

DONNA: I’d invite you up, but the place is being painted.

JERRY: Oh, that’s okay.

DONNA: Unless you want to go to your place.

JERRY: Okay... but there’s no cake or anything, if that’s what you’re looking for.



INT. GEORGE’S CAR (MOVING) – CONTINUED

GEORGE: (frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry and Donna sit on the sofa.)

JERRY: I think if one’s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It’s common courtesy. I don’t know. That’s just the way I was brought up.

DONNA: Values are very important.

JERRY: Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?

DONNA: Thursday’s great.

(Pause. Jerry looks down at his pants.)

JERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don’t feel comfortable in them.

DONNA: Are those Cotton Dockers?

JERRY: Oh, I can’t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.

DONNA: Really? I like that commercial.

(Donna gets closer and more comfortable leaning on Jerry. Jerry Pauses thinking about what she said)

JERRY: You like that commercial?

DONNA: Yeah, it’s clever.

JERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?

DONNA: Yeah, that’s the one.

JERRY: What could you possibly like about that?

DONNA: I don’t know. I like the, guys.

JERRY: Yeah, they’re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.

DONNA : Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.

(After Jerry sits back again, Donna continues get more comfortable in Jerry's arms. Jerry pauses.)

JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn’t that bother you?

DONNA: (annoyed) That’s the idea. That’s what’s clever about it, that they’re not talking about the pants.

JERRY: But they’re talking about nothing.

DONNA: That’s the point.

JERRY: I know the point.

DONNA: No one is telling you to like it.

JERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?

(Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry and looks at her watch.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: What’s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy’ll be like, “I don’t think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?” And of course the woman’s looking at the guy, thinking, “What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are talking.)

JERRY: I’m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?

ELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didn’t keep his bathroom clean enough.

JERRY: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there – they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

(George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag.)

ELAINE: Hi.

(George produces a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and box of bicarb (sic) from bag, placing them on counter.)

JERRY: You’re still thinking about this?

GEORGE: She invites me up at twelve o’clock at night, for coffee, and I don’t go up. “No thank you. I don’t want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.” I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn’t be allowed to live. I can’t imagine what she must think of me.

JERRY: She thinks you’re a guy that doesn’t like coffee.

GEORGE: She invited me up. Coffee’s not coffee, coffee is sex.

ELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.

GEORGE: Coffee’s coffee in the morning. It’s not coffee at twelve o’clock at night.

ELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.

GEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who’re on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, “Keep it up, don’t blow it, you’re doing great.”

ELAINE: It’s all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.

GEORGE: I can’t call her now. It’s too soon. I’m planning a Wednesday call.

ELAINE: Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.

GEORGE: Of course you do, but you’re imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, “Oh no, I don’t drink coffee late at night.” If I call her now, she’s gonna think I’m too needy. Women don’t wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy – a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.

ELAINE: All she’ll think is that you like her.

GEORGE: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!

ELAINE: Well, she wants you to like her.

GEORGE: Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn’t like me!

ELAINE: I don’t know what your parents did to you.

(Kramer enters and addresses Jerry.)

KRAMER: Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you’re up there, you’re on the stage and you go, “Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone’s in a life-and-death situation, and we’re thinking, “Well, sorry buddy, you should’ve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.”

(Elaine laughs. Jerry humors Kramer with a smile.)

KRAMER: So you gonna use it?

JERRY : I don’t think so.

KRAMER: It’s funny.

ELAINE: It is funny.

JERRY: I like to use my own material.

KRAMER: That’s as good as anything you do.

GEORGE: All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.

JERRY: Why do we have to leave?

GEORGE: Because I can’t call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let’s go.

ELAINE: Oh, see, this is the problem.

JERRY: You’re kicking me out of my house?

GEORGE: Yes.

(Jerry exits. Elaine is in the doorway.)

ELAINE: (encouraging) Don’t forget.

GEORGE: (to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?

JERRY: Don’t do the apples. It’s enough already with the apples.

(Elaine, Kramer and Jerry exit. George removes his jacket and dials the phone.)

CAROL: (from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, it’s Carol, I’ll get back to you.

(A beep follows.)

GEORGE: Um, hi, it’s George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn’t come up for coffee. You see, I didn’t realise that coffee didn’t really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It’s up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball’s in your court. So uh, take it easy.

(George hangs up. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: I’m just gonna get my jacket, I’ll meet you downstairs. What’s the matter, did you call?

(Elaine enters.)

GEORGE: Got her machine. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. That’s it. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. Dead man.

JERRY: What did you say?

GEORGE: I don’t know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there’s nothing I can do. It’s a machine. The little light is blinking right now, “Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot’s on!”

JERRY: After one date you try and improvise on her machine?

GEORGE: Now I’m in the worst position of all.

ELAINE: Y’know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy’s machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn’t supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy’s house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.

GEORGE: He did that?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Somebody did that?

JERRY: She’ll call you back. You’re overreacting.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is in the kitchen. Donna is on the other side of the counter.)

JERRY: Not once.

DONNA: Never?

JERRY: I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.

DONNA: That’s amazing.

JERRY: Thank you.

DONNA: Is there anything else about you I should know?

JERRY: Yes, I’m lactose intolerant.

DONNA: Really?

JERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I won’t stand for it. Um, I’ll be right back.

(Jerry goes to the bathroom. George bursts into the apartment.)

GEORGE: Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, I’m sorry, I didn’t, I had no idea.

(He goes to leave.)

DONNA: Wait, wait. He’s in the bathroom.

GEORGE: I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I’ll come back.

DONNA: You don’t have to leave.

GEORGE: You sure?

DONNA: Yes.

GEORGE: Okay.

DONNA: I’m Donna.

GEORGE: Donna. Oh, you’re the one that likes that commercial!

DONNA: He told you about that?

GEORGE: (back-pedalling) No, he, he didn’t actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial – in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He’s, he’s like a clam. You’re not gonna mention this, to him...

(Jerry re-enters.)

DONNA: (to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I’m not hip because I like that commercial.

JERRY: What? (to George) What did, what did you say?

GEORGE: Say? What? Nothing, I...

DONNA: You told him how I like the commercial.

JERRY: Well, so what if I said that?

DONNA: Well, so, you didn’t have to tell your friends.

JERRY: No, I had to tell my friends – my friends didn’t have to tell you.

GEORGE: (to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?

DONNA: I don’t like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.

GEORGE: Boy oh boy.

JERRY: I said I couldn’t believe you liked that commercial. So what?

DONNA: I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.

JERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.

KRAMER: Oh. Cotton Dockers!

GEORGE: Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...

(George grabs Kramer.)

KRAMER: What? Where are we going?

GEORGE: Come on!

DONNA: Don’t bother, I’m leaving.

JERRY: Donna, really, you’re making too much of this.

KRAMER: “One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they’re not Dockers, they’re just pants”

JERRY: Please, Donna...

DONNA: I don’t wanna hear it.

(Donna leaves.)

GEORGE: I can’t believe I said that. You know me, I’m a vault.

JERRY: Don’t worry about it, it wasn’t working anyway.

KRAMER: What happened there?

JERRY: I’ll tell you later.

GEORGE: You are not gonna believe what’s going on with this woman.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George and Jerry sat at a booth.)

GEORGE: Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn’t call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, “I know you’re there, I don’t know what your story is.” Yesterday, I’m a volcano – I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, “Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don’t call me back for four days? I don’t like coffee, I don’t have to come up. I’d like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.”

JERRY: You said that?

GEORGE: I lost it.

JERRY: I can’t blame you. I can’t believe she never called you back.

GEORGE: She did. Today.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: She called my office. She said she’s been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn’t know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she’s been using her old machine and she doesn’t have the beeper for it.

JERRY: So she didn’t get the messages.

GEORGE: Exactly, but they’re on there – waiting. She said she can’t wait to see me, we’re having dinner tonight. She’s supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.

JERRY: But what about the messages?

(George produces cassette tape from pocket.)

JERRY: Elaine’s thing? How you gonna get in?

GEORGE: I’ll meet her outside the building.

JERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she’s going right for that machine.

GEORGE: Unless she goes for the bathroom. That’s my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I can’t do this, I can’t do this. I don’t even know how to work those stupid machines.

JERRY: There’s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.

GEORGE: You do it for me.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Come on, it’ll be so much easier.

JERRY: How you gonna get me up there?

GEORGE: I’ll tell her I bumped into you, I’m giving you a ride uptown.

JERRY: And who makes the switch?

GEORGE: You do.

JERRY: I do.

GEORGE : I can’t do it. I’ll, I’ll keep her busy.

JERRY: I can’t get involved in this.

GEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.

JERRY: What if she sees me?

GEORGE: Oh, you are such a wuss.

JERRY: A wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Did you call me a wuss?



EXT. CAROL’S BUILDING – NIGHT

(George and Jerry are sitting on a low wall beside the door to the building.)

GEORGE: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.

JERRY: I got one problem. You’re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she’s coming.

GEORGE: A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I’ll call out tippy-toe!

JERRY: Tippy Toe? I don’t think so.

GEORGE: You don’t like tippy toe?

JERRY: No tippy toe.

GEORGE: All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I’ll sing.

JERRY: What song?

GEORGE: “How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?”

JERRY: What is that?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s a lovely song. (singing) “How do you solve a problem like Maria?...”

JERRY: Anything else?

GEORGE: You pick it.

JERRY: “Lemon Tree.”

GEORGE: Peter, Paul and Mary.

JERRY: No, Trini Lopez.

JERRY & GEORGE: (singing) “Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...”

GEORGE: Alright ok. You got the tape?

(Jerry takes out two different sizes of cassettes.)

JERRY: Standard. Micro.

GEORGE: How do you feel? Confident?

JERRY: Feel good.

GEORGE: You nervous?

JERRY: Not at all.

GEORGE: Get up, get up, it’s her! Oh, the hell with this, I’m scared to death, just walk away, it’s off, cancel everything, go!

(Carol enters.)

CAROL: Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.

GEORGE: I, I couldn’t wait. I was too anxious to see you.

CAROL: Oh, that’s so sweet.

GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn’t that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.

JERRY: All the time.

CAROL: It’s nice to meet you.

JERRY: Hi.

CAROL: So, I’m starving. Where are we gonna eat?

GEORGE: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.

CAROL: Okay. Let’s go, I’m ready, where’d you park?

GEORGE: Don’t you wanna go upstairs first?

CAROL: No, what for? I’ll just give my bag to the doorman.

JERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.

CAROL: Oh well there’s a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...

CAROL: Well they have a phone.

(George takes Carol aside.)

GEORGE: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.

CAROL: (aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.

GEORGE: Right, right.

(They enter her building.)



INT. CAROL’S APARTMENT – CONTINUING

(Carol, Jerry and George enter.)

CAROL: The bathroom’s on the hall to the right.

JERRY: Uh, you know, why don’t you go first, you just had a long trip.

CAROL: No, I’m fine.

JERRY: Um, you know, it’s the damnedest thing. It went away.

CAROL: Oh, that’s weird.

GEORGE: No, no that can happen. I’ve, uh, I’ve read about that in medical journals. It’s a freak thing, but...

CAROL: Well, let me just check my messages, and we’ll go.

GEORGE: Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?

CAROL: Sure.

GEORGE: Please, this is very, very important.

(George leads her to another room. Jerry goes over and lifts the lid of the machine.)

GEORGE: (from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!

(Carol reappears, followed by George.)

CAROL: (to Jerry) Now I know who you are! You’re a comedian. I’ve seen you, it’s driving me crazy.

JERRY: Right. I am.

GEORGE: Carol, that’s so rude. Please, I’m serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn’t mind. And then we’ll talk to Jerry.

(George leads Carol back out. Jerry switches the tapes.)

JERRY: (calls) Hey you two. I’m ready to go.

(George and Carol return.)

CAROL: That’s what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Don’t you find that strange?

JERRY: Yes.

CAROL: Well, I’ll just check my machine and we’ll go.

(She lifts the lid of the machine, and drops it.)

CAROL: No, nothing here, let’s go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.

GEORGE: Oh, uh...

CAROL: Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.

(Carol exits. Jerry laughs acidly while looking at George. They exit as well.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry in on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn’t want to talk to, I could go, “Excuse me, I’m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.” I also have a cordless phone, but I don’t like that as much, because you can’t slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!” Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!”
(Jerry searches for the ‘off’ button on his mimed phone, and presses it feebly.) “I told him!”

JERRY: I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don’t know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it’s really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I’ve received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn’t even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that’s what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, “You may have already won.” I’d like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, “You have definitely lost!” You turn it over, giant printing, “Not even close!” You open it up, there’s this whole letter of explanation, “Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is reading a newspaper. Kramer and Jerry struggle to fit a large cardboard box with the name Seinfeld on it, through the doorway.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) To the right.

(They get it through, and walk towards the table.)

GEORGE: That took awhile.

JERRY: Don’t get up.

GEORGE: I’d like to help, but my neck..

(They set the box on the table.)

GEORGE: So how long has it been in the basement?

JERRY: Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn’t want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it’s been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and let’s get it out of here.

(They open the box, and start going through it.)

GEORGE: What’s in it?

JERRY: Grandpa clothes, I can’t wear ‘em.

(Kramer pulls out some black socks.)

KRAMER: You want these? Knee socks. You don’t wear knee socks.

JERRY: No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can’t wait to get it cleaned.

GEORGE: I know someone who’ll do it. She’s good. She’s honest.

JERRY: No, Elaine’s got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he’s suppose to do it.

GEORGE: Students can’t clean. It’s anathema. (explaining) They don’t like it.

JERRY: How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?

(Kramer pulls a statue out of the box.)

KRAMER: Now this I like.

GEORGE: Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramer’s hands.) I can’t believe this! Let me see this.

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait...

(George grabs the statue.)

GEORGE: Let me just see it.

KRAMER: Come on...

GEORGE: Let me just see it for a second.

(He pries it from Kramer’s hands.)

GEORGE: Oh my God, it’s exactly the same!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, “MacArthur Park”, and I got to the part about, “I’ll never have that recipe again,” and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.

(Kramer grabs the statue back. George grips it, but Kramer wont let go. They start to fight for it.)

KRAMER: C’mon, George. I saw it first.

GEORGE: No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.

KRAMER: No, I got dibs!

GEORGE: What? No dibs! I need this statue. C’mon, give it!

(Jerry breaks it up.)

JERRY: Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don’t you just settle it like mature adults?

(Kramer sticks out his fist.)

KRAMER: Potato man!

GEORGE: No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.

(Kramer and George both add up in their heads to see who would lose if Inka-Dink was the way to go.)

KRAMER: Okay...yea well uh start with me.

GEORGE: Yeah, good, good.

(Jerry begins the childish choosing game of Inka-dink, pointing alternately between Kramer and George with every accented syllable.)

JERRY: Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.

(He lands on George. George starts to recalculate his choice.)

JERRY: Not because you’re dirty, not because you’re clean – just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...

(He lands on Kramer. Kramer smiles.)

JERRY: And you are it!

(He lands on George.)

KRAMER: What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He’s out. I get it.

GEORGE: No, no, no, no, I’m It. I win.

JERRY: No, he’s It. He wins. It is good.

KRAMER: Do over – start with him.

JERRY: No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.

KRAMER: All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)

GEORGE: (not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.

KRAMER: Okay, I’m gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.

JERRY: All right, c’mon. Let’s go.

(Kramer puts on the hat.)

KRAMER: Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.

(He hums the theme song.)

GEORGE: I can’t believe I won at Inka-dink.

JERRY: Come on, let’s go.

GEORGE: Yea.

(They go to the door. George sets down the statue on the kitchen counter.)

JERRY: Aren’t you gonna take it?

GEORGE: No, no, no, I don’t want to carry it around all night. I’ll pick it up later.

GEORGE: (to Kramer) What about your stuff?

KRAMER: Oh, uh, well - okay.

(He balls up the clothes in his hands, throws them into his apartment and leaves.)

JERRY: All right, let’s go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: The Inka-dink.. You were It.

GEORGE: It’s bad?

JERRY: It’s very bad.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Elaine and a writer, RAVA, are in the living room.)

RAVA: Well, if they don’t let you be my editor on this book, I’ll go to another publisher. It’s that simple.

ELAINE: You told them that?

RAVA: Of course.

ELAINE: (excited) This is so fantastic. I don’t know how to thank you.

(Jerry enters for the bedroom, carrying luggage.)

JERRY: (to Rava) So, where’s this boyfriend of yours? I can’t wait much longer. I’ve got a flight.

ELAINE: Oh, probably caught in traffic.

RAVA: Or maybe he’s dead.

JERRY: So what do you write, children’s books?

(There’s a knock at the door.)

RAVA: That’s Ray.

(Ray enters with cleaning gear.)

RAY: Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.

(Ray bows.)

JERRY: All right...

RAVA: And we have to get back to work.

(She exits with Elaine.)

JERRY: I gotta get to the airport.

RAY: Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.

JERRY: The uh toilet brush is under the sink.

(Jerry exits.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I don’t really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there’s that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you’re sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, “I’m really sorry about this. I don’t know why I left that stuff over there.” And that’s why I could never be a maid, because I’d have an attitude. I’d find them, wherever they are in the house, “Oh, I suppose you couldn’t do this? No, don’t get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn’t dust. No, this is too tough, isn’t it?”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry is talking to Elaine.)

JERRY: He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!

ELAINE: There’s no Rubber Man.

JERRY: Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There’s Elastic Man... Plastic Man...

ELAINE: I’m leaving.

JERRY: Where are you going?

ELAINE: To Rava’s house. I’ve gotta pick up her manuscript.

JERRY: Oh wait. I’ll go with you.

(They both head toward the door. Jerry opens it.)

JERRY: Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!

(Elaine and Jerry exit.)



INT. RAVA & RAY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry, Elaine, and Rava sit in the living room.)

ELAINE: (to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He’s the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-

RAVA: Demand.

ELAINE: They're going to promote me to editor.

RAVA: Daantotin. (There is a sound of the front door being unlocked.) There’s Ray... late as usual.

(Ray enters.)

RAY: Well, this is an unexpected surprise – and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, we’re in the presence of royalty.

JERRY: Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.

RAY: But I didn’t just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.

JERRY: Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?

(They all laugh. Jerry looks at Ray’s mantle. George’s statue catches his eye.)

RAVA: The water is boiling. Are you having tea?

ELAINE & RAY: Yes.

(Jerry is not listening. Rava enters the kitchen.)

ELAINE: Jerry? Jerry!

(Jerry snaps out of it.)

JERRY: What?

RAVA: (from the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?

RAY: Yeah, I’m coming!

(Ray enters the kitchen. As soon as both Rava and Ray are in the kitchen, Jerry and Elaine start talking in loud whispers.)

JERRY: I think that’s the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!

ELAINE: What statue?

JERRY: I had a statue!

ELAINE: You have a statue? I never saw a statue.

JERRY: My grandfather gave me a statue!

ELAINE: Since when?

JERRY: What’s the difference?! That’s the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!

(Ray pops his head back into the living room.)

RAY: Do you take sugar?

JERRY & ELAINE: Uhh... no.

(Ray goes back into the kitchen.)

JERRY: I can’t believe it! This guy ripped me off!

ELAINE: Do you realize what you’re saying?

JERRY: Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!

(Ray pops in again.)

RAY: Lemon?

JERRY & ELAINE: Uh... sure/yeah..

(Ray goes back into the kitchen.)

ELAINE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.

ELAINE: Ninety-nine percent sure?!

(Ray and Rava both enter, carrying a tray of tea.)

RAY: Ah, sweet elixir. It’s fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.

(Jerry smells it suspiciously. A ding from the kitchen can be heard.)

RAVA: Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript.

RAY: Ah, the pastries!

(Ray and Rava exit in different directions.)

ELAINE: Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it’s just a coincidence.

JERRY: Coincidence? This guy’s in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?

ELAINE: I never saw the statue.

JERRY: I had a statue! What should I do?

ELAINE: I don’t know.

JERRY: I’ll call Kramer. He can check my house.

(Jerry grabs the phone and dials.)

ELAINE: Oh Jerry, don’t blow this for me.

JERRY: Don’t worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... It’s Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...

(Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually into the phone.)

JERRY: Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.

RAVA: My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope she’s rotting in an alley somewhere!

(Pause.)

JERRY: My mom’s down in Florida. She’s got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?

(Ray enters with a tray of pastries.)

RAY: I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.

JERRY: Listen, uh I just remembered... I’m... uh, getting a facial.

(Elaine takes the manuscript.)

ELAINE: Oh, see you tomorrow morning.

(They go to leave.)

RAY: How about dinner?

JERRY: No, I don’t eat dinner. Dinner’s for suckers.

(Elaine and Jerry exit.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry is on the phone. Jerry and Elaine are next to him. Kramer sits in the living room.)

JERRY: Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.

(He hangs up.)

JERRY: Nope, the cop says it’s my word against his. There’s nothing they can do.

KRAMER: Let’s go get him.

JERRY: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: We can’t just let him get away with this.

JERRY: Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it’s missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He’s crazy.

KRAMER: You wanna go get him?

ELAINE: Well, then, if he’s crazy you should just forget it.

GEORGE: Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother’s making her roasted potatoes!

ELAINE: George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?

GEORGE: Who is this Rava?

KRAMER: I say we get him.

ELAINE: No!

GEORGE: Let me just call him.

JERRY: I’ll call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Rava’s friend, Elaine’s friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you don’t want to talk about it over the phone?.. You don’t want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk’s?... All right, tomorrow... One o’ clock... Great, okay, bye.

(Jerry hangs up.)

ELAINE: All right, look, look, look. Let’s say he stole it.

GEORGE: Oh, he stole it!

ELAINE: C’mon, you can’t do anything about it. The cops won’t do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don’t you just forget it?

(Jerry and George look at each other.)

JERRY & GEORGE: No.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry sits alone at a booth. George sits in the booth behind him.)

GEORGE: I thought you said one o’clock.

JERRY: Relax, he’s late. He’s always late. It’s part of his M.O.

GEORGE: Remember, don’t take any crap.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry about it.

GEORGE: I’ll be right here.

(Ray enters.)

JERRY: That’s comforting. Shh. He’s coming. (to Ray) Ray?

(Ray sits opposite Jerry.)

RAY: Oh, Jerry. I can’t believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could’ve got me into?

JERRY: Well, I didn’t...

RAY: Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.

GEORGE: (muttering to himself) I wonder why.

JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I won’t say anything.

RAY: Give it back?

JERRY: Yeah.

RAY: What are you talking about?

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: What is he talking about?

RAY: I’m talking about the statue.

JERRY: Yeah, me too.

RAY: Give it back to whom?

JERRY: Me.

GEORGE: Yeah, him.

RAY: You?

JERRY: Yeah. Me.

RAY: I’m not getting this.

GEORGE: You already got it.

JERRY: Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house – and then I saw it in your house.

RAY: What are you saying?

JERRY: What am I saying?

GEORGE: Take a wild guess.

RAY: Are you saying I stole your statue?

GEORGE: What a mind.

JERRY: Well, I...

RAY: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

JERRY: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

GEORGE: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

RAY: For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.

GEORGE: Pawn shop?

JERRY: A pawn shop?

RAY: Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people’s apartments.

GEORGE: Cleaning them out.

(Jerry elbows George in an attempt to shut him up.)

JERRY: Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.

RAY: What’s behind this? It’s Rava, isn’t it?

GEORGE: Again with the Rava.

RAY: You want her.

JERRY: No, she’s a little too cheery for me.

RAY: She’s from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!

JERRY: I know Finland. They’re neutral.

RAY: Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?

JERRY: No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...

GEORGE: “Oh, I find you so charming.” You wuss.

JERRY: (to George) Did you call me a wuss?

RAY: What did you say?

JERRY: I said luss. I’m at a luss.

RAY: I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.

JERRY: That’s not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe it’s not that bad an idea.

RAY: And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.

GEORGE: Singapore?! Do you hear this?

RAY: If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.

(George stands up and addresses Ray.)

GEORGE: That’s it! That’s it! I can’t take it. I can’t take it anymore! You stole the statue! You’re a theif! You’re a liar!

JERRY: George...

RAY: Who is this?

GEORGE: I’m the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!

RAY: What’s going on here?

GEORGE: GUILTY!

RAY: Your friend is crazy.

GEORGE: Oh, I’m crazy!

JERRY: George, george...

RAY: I’ve got to get going. I have a class.

GEORGE: Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar’s office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!

RAY: Well, that’s because I’m registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.

GEORGE: You mean alias.

RAY: You are starting to make me angry!

GEORGE: Well, that was bound to happen.

RAY: (to Jerry) I hope you think about what you’ve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.

(Ray heads for the door.)

JERRY: Hey, Ray.

(Ray stops and turns around.)

RAY: Yes?

JERRY: How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING LOBBY – DAY

(Elaine and Rava are waiting for an elevator.)

ELAINE: Nervous?

RAVA: Why should I be?

ELAINE: Yeah. Right.

RAVA: Your notes are very insightful.

ELAINE: The book is great. Did you go out last night?

RAVA: No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.

ELAINE: They all are.

RAVA: Was Jerry?

ELAINE: I can’t remember.

(The elevator doors open. They step in.)

RAVA: You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.

ELAINE: Oh, well, I’m staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.

(The elevator doors close.)



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING – LATER

(Outside the elevator, on another floor. The doors open, revealing Rava and Elaine in front of a crowd of people.)

RAVA: So you think he stole it?!

ELAINE: Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...

RAVA: I admit nothing!

(The doors close.)



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING ELEVATOR – CONTINUING

(A MAN behind them addresses Rava.)

MAN: Will you put that cigarette out, please?

(Rava ignores him.)

ELAINE: Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it’s gone and it’s in your apartment.

RAVA: Maybe you think we’re in cahoots.

ELAINE: No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.

RAVA: Yes, that’s all: a coincidence!

ELAINE: A big coincidence.

RAVA: Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!

ELAINE: No, that’s a big coincidence.

RAVA: That’s what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!

ELAINE: No, there are degrees of coincidences.

RAVA: No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone!

(Enraged, she poses the question to everyone in the elevator.)

RAVA: Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!

(Everyone just shrugs and murmurs. The doors open.)

MAN: Will you put that cigarette out?!

RAVA: Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It’s just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. You’re trying to destroy us.

ELAINE: Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?

(The doors close.)



INT. PENDANT PUBLISHING – DAY

(Outside the elevator on yet another floor. The doors open. The elevator is empty except for Elaine. There is a janitor’s cart parked right outside the doors. She steps out, throws the manuscript into the garbage can on the cart and exits.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is on the phone. Elaine and Jerry are beside him. Kramer is sitting on a living room chair again.)

GEORGE: Ma, will you stop?... It’s just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didn’t even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I don’t see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesn’t react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.

KRAMER: I’m not happy about this.

ELAINE: Why don’t we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?

GEORGE: There’s just no justice. This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: (casually) Sure, why not.

ELAINE: Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.

JERRY: Can’t you talk to your boss?

ELAINE: I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think you’re funny at all.

KRAMER: (talking to himself) I’m not happy about this.

JERRY: Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..

GEORGE: Yeah, he’ll have my parents.



INT. RAVA & RAY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Ray is home alone. There’s a knock at the door.)

KRAMER: (from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!

RAY: Police?

(He opens the door a crack. Kramer barges in. He is wearing Jerry’s grandfather’s suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall face first.)

KRAMER: Freeze, mother!

(Ray turns toward Kramer.)

RAY: Hey.

(Kramer shoves him against the wall.)

KRAMER: Shut up. Spread ‘em. I said spread ‘em! (looks around) You’re in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.

(Ray turns toward Kramer.)

RAY: Murder?!

(Kramer shoves him against the wall.)

KRAMER: Shut up! Keep ‘em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!

RAY: I think you have me confused with somebody else.

KRAMER: Is your name Ray?

RAY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah, you’re the punk I’m looking for!

(Kramer grabs the statue from the mantle and puts it in his bag. Ray turns toward Kramer.)

RAY: Hey, hey, are you a cop?

KRAMER: Yeah, I’m a cop. I’m a good cop. I’m a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Today’s your lucky day, junior, ‘cause I’m gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you’ll be sorry. You got me?

RAY: Got you? I don’t even know what the hell you’re talking about.

KRAMER: Good, good. Let’s uh keep it that way.

(Kramer exits.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Kramer leads Jerry, Elaine, and George into the apartment.)

JERRY: All right, all right. What’s the big hubbub, bub?

(Kramer runs to his apartment, then returns with a duffel bag. He places it on the table, and reveals the statue from it. Everyone is Shocked)

GEORGE: Kramer, I can’t believe it. Oh, you’re my hero!

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Kramer, what did you do?

KRAMER: Well, let’s just say I didn’t take him to People’s Court.

GEORGE: I feel like a huge weight’s been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I don’t know how to thank you!

KRAMER: Well, I’ll think of something.

(Kramer slaps George on the back, knocking the statue out of his hands and sending it crashing to the ground.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You can’t stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, who’s gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can’t get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.

JERRY: Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude." 



[Office complex; Levitan's office]

LEVITAN: (on the phone) Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing) 

(George bursts into the office)

GEORGE: That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit! 



[Jerry's Apartment]

(Jerry exits his bedroom with a bag of laundry; Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey. 

JERRY: Hey. 

KRAMER: Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself. 

JERRY: Well, what'd you say? 

KRAMER: I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something. 

JERRY: What's his problem? 

KRAMER: No job. No women. 

JERRY: He called the right guy. 

KRAMER: Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him? 

JERRY: All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry. 

KRAMER: Why don't you use the machines down in the basement? 

JERRY: Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight. 

KRAMER: How 'bout if I put a few things -- 

JERRY: Wait a sec. I don't wanna do -- 

KRAMER: Well, you're going over there. 

JERRY: I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot. 

KRAMER: Have you ever met my guys? 

JERRY: No. I can't say as I have. 

KRAMER: Well! 

JERRY: All right. Put 'em on top. 

KRAMER: Ah! 

JERRY: Oh, beautiful. 



[Laundromat]

JERRY: This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine? 

VIC: I'll have to charge you for another machine. 

JERRY: Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across. 

(George shows up)

GEORGE: Guess what. 

JERRY: How did you know I was here? 

GEORGE: Kramer. Guess what. 

JERRY: I don't know. 

GEORGE: I quit my job. 

JERRY: Get outta here. 

GEORGE: I couldn't take it anymore. 

VIC: You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket)

JERRY: What happened? Levitan? 

GEORGE: I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting! 

JERRY: You and your toilets. 

GEORGE: I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs) 

JERRY: So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate? 

GEORGE: Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. 

JERRY: So what are you gonna do? 

(George realizes he's made a mistake)



[Jerry's Apartment]

GEORGE: I like sports. I could do something in sports. 

JERRY: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity? 

GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something. 

JERRY: Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. 

GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game. 

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments. 

GEORGE: What about that? 

JERRY: Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting. 

GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair. 

JERRY: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like? 

GEORGE: Movies. I like to watch movies. 

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. 

GEORGE: Do they pay people to watch movies? 

JERRY: Projectionists. 

GEORGE: That's true. 

JERRY: But you gotta know how to work the projector. 

GEORGE: Right. 

JERRY: And it's probably a union thing. 

GEORGE: (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host? 

JERRY: Talk show host. That's good. 

GEORGE: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host. 

JERRY: Really? 

GEORGE: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start? 

JERRY: Well, that's where it gets tricky. 

GEORGE: You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host." 

JERRY: I wouldn't think so. 

GEORGE: It's all politics. 

JERRY: All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else? 

GEORGE: This could have been a huge mistake. 

JERRY: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through. 

GEORGE: (sighs) Guess not. What should I do? 

JERRY: Maybe you can just go back. 

GEORGE: Go back? 

JERRY: Yeah. Pretend like it never happened. 

GEORGE: You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened? 

JERRY: Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously. 

GEORGE: Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened. 

JERRY: Never happened. 

GEORGE: I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what? 

JERRY: So what? You're entitled. 

GEORGE: I'm emotional. 

JERRY: That's right. You're emotional. 

GEORGE: Never happened. 

JERRY: Never happened. 



[Middle Monologue]

JERRY: To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."



[Office complex; Staff Meeting]

(George enters)

GEORGE: How ya doin'? 

GLENDA: What are you doing here? 

GEORGE: What? I work here. 

GLENDA: I thought you quit. 

GEORGE: What quit? (laughing) Who quit? 

DAN: Bill, how was your weekend? 

BILL: Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend? 

DAN: Fine weekend. 

GEORGE: Yeah. Good weekend. 

DAN: Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday. 

GEORGE: Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor. 

(Levitan enters; George covers his face with a folder)

LEVITAN: Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon? 

AVA: Oh, I got a little tied up. 

LEVITAN: I'll bet you did. 

(laughter breaks out in boardroom) 

LEVITAN: I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here? 

GEORGE: What? 

LEVITAN: Am I crazy, or didn't you quit? 

GEORGE: When? 

LEVITAN: Friday. 

GEORGE: Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously? 

LEVITAN: You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff? 

GEORGE: Come on. Will you stop it. 

LEVITAN: No brains? No ability? 

GEORGE: Teasing. 

LEVITAN: Okay. I want you outta here. 

GEORGE: I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?

DAN: I wouldn't say all the time.

LEVITAN: You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser. 



[Laundromat]

GEORGE: " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me. 

JERRY: Well, so that's that. 

GEORGE: No. That's not that. 

JERRY: That's not that? 

GEORGE: No. 

JERRY: Well, if that's not that, what is that? 

GEORGE: I've got some plans. I got plans. 

JERRY: What kind of plans? 

GEORGE: What's the difference? 

JERRY: You don't wanna tell me? 

GEORGE: I'm gonna slip him a mickey. 

JERRY: What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre? 

GEORGE: You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing. 

JERRY: What if you destroy him? 

GEORGE: No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over. 

JERRY: Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal. 

GEORGE: This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey! 

JERRY: You've really gone mental. 

GEORGE: Nah. 

JERRY: Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"! 

GEORGE: I got a source. 

JERRY: You got a mickey source? 

GEORGE: And Elaine is gonna keep him busy. 

JERRY: Elaine? How did you rope her into this? 

GEORGE: I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife. 

JERRY: She knew that. 

GEORGE: But she didn't know he doesn't recycle. 

JERRY: What is the point of all this? 

GEORGE: Revenge. 

JERRY: Oh, the best revenge is living well. 

GEORGE: There's no chance of that. 



[Jerry's apartment]

(Kramer enters somewhat depressed)

JERRY: Did you get your laundry? 

KRAMER: Yeah. 

JERRY: What's with you? 

KRAMER: He jumped. 

JERRY: What? 

KRAMER: Yeah. Newman jumped. 

JERRY: Did he call you last night? 

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

JERRY: What did you say? 

KRAMER: I said " Wave to me when you pass my window." 

JERRY: Whew. Did he wave? 

KRAMER: No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me. 

JERRY: (realizing something) Oh, my god! 

KRAMER: What's the matter? 

JERRY: (tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go. 

KRAMER: Where? Where? 

JERRY: To the Laundromat. 



[Laundromat]

VIC: I never saw it. 

KRAMER: Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing? 

VIC: Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying "Not Responsible for Valuables"

JERRY: Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society. 

VIC: Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution. I'm not responsible. 

JERRY: So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry? 

VIC: You ever hear of a bank? 

JERRY: Come on. Let's go. 

KRAMER: No. You can't let him get away with this. 



[Office party at the Bar]

(Elaine and George staking out the bar)

ELAINE: Which one is he? 

GEORGE: That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish. 

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I see him. 

GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this. 

ELAINE: Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison? 

GEORGE: This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done. 

ELAINE: Yeah. It is kind of cool. 

GEORGE: First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone. 

ELAINE: I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies. 

GEORGE: That's exactly what I told Jerry! 

ELAINE: Really? 

GEORGE: Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive! 



[Laundromat]

(Jerry is carrying a large bag of clothes)

JERRY: Maybe we should call this off. 

KRAMER: Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine. 

JERRY: And what's gonna happen? 

KRAMER: Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block! 

JERRY: If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor. 

KRAMER: You keep him busy. 

(Kramer, holding heavy bag of concrete in arms, stumbles to machine, knocking chairs around) 

(Kramer plops concrete down onto washing machine) 

KRAMER: Whoa! 

(lifting bag into the air, Kramer, thrown off balance, stumbles backwards and slams into the dryer) 



[Office party at the Bar]

(George and Elaine are in the corner talking)

GEORGE: You go over there - 

ELAINE: Yeah. 

GEORGE: You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink. 

ELAINE: Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth? 

(George motions for her to do it. Elaine walks over to where Levitan is sitting)

LEVITAN: Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield. 

ELAINE: Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me. 

LEVITAN: Yeah. 

GREENY: I'm gonna get some food. You want some? 

LEVITAN: Nah. 

ELAINE: Hi. 

LEVITAN: Hi. 

ELAINE: (sneezes) 

LEVITAN: God bless you. 

ELAINE: Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou! 

LEVITAN: (confused) You're welcome. 

ELAINE: People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that? 

LEVITAN: No. 

ELAINE: (having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week. 

LEVITAN: (interested) Nudist colony? 

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah! 

LEVITAN: (laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony. 

ELAINE: Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked. 

LEVITAN: Seriously? 

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. 

(George makes his move; Glenda is occupying the seat next to Levitan)

GEORGE: (whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat? 

GLENDA: (loud) What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats. 

GEORGE: (whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here. 

GLENDA: (loud) What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired. 

GEORGE: (whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine. 

ELAINE: I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked. 

LEVITAN: Who are you? 

ELAINE: Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble. 



[Laundromat]

(Back to Kramer after hitting the dryer; Picks up the concrete makes his way back to the washer; opens the lid on the machine, it slams shut forcing Kramer to pour the concrete all over the machine)

JERRY: (trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? 

(opening lid, Kramer begins to contort & flail arms about as a cloud of concrete covers his face) 

JERRY: Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle? 

(Kramer emptying bag into machine) 

JERRY: What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament? 

(finished with machine, Kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag & drops it on the floor) 

(Kramer giving "OK" sign) 

(Kramer starting machine & trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of the machine) 

JERRY: What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks? 

(Kramer walks over to where Jerry is standing, his entire body covered with dry concrete) 

KRAMER: I didn't realize it was a full box. 



[Office party; Bar]

GEORGE: (trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off. 

GLENDA: I don't' wear a wig. 

GEORGE: One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)

ELAINE: No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around. 

(Levitan & Elaine laughing) 

ELAINE: I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra. 

(George empties contents of tiny bottle into Levitan's drink) 

(Elaine & Levitan laughing) 

GEORGE: Hello, Rick. 

LEVITAN: Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here! 

GEORGE: That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! 

LEVITAN: You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man. 

GEORGE: Oh! 

LEVITAN: I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap. 

GEORGE: Boom! 

(all laughing) 

LEVITAN: You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh? 

GEORGE: Oh. 

LEVITAN: Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back. (George is shocked) You can use my bathroom anytime you want. 

GEORGE: You want me to come back? Uh... 

LEVITAN: Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast! 

GEORGE: Rick. 

LEVITAN: Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties. 

GEORGE: Uh, Rick.. 

LEVITAN: And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that possible.. 

GEORGE: Rick. 

LEVITAN: I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this? 

GEORGE: Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)



[Jerry's Apartment]

(George is sitting at the coffee table; Jerry and Elaine on the couch)

GEORGE: I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something. 

ELAINE: Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree. 

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: Yeah. That's true. 

KRAMER: (seeing Jerry is with people) Oh.

JERRY: What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it? 

KRAMER: It was in my laundry. 

JERRY: In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be? 

KRAMER: It was about 1200 bucks. 

NEWMAN: Kramer! 

KRAMER: Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)

NEWMAN: I'm on the roof! 

KRAMER: (yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for? 

JERRY: Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money.. 

(Elaine and Jerry leave)

GEORGE: (talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy. 

KRAMER: You wanna shoot some pool tonight? 

NEWMAN: I can't. I'm goin' to a movie. 

GEORGE: (talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing. 


[Closing Monologue]

JERRY: People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'

JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV)

TV VOICE: (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..

(Jerry's now asleep)

[Setting: Jerry's bedroom]

(Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his head, then goes back to sleep, laughing to himself)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Coffee shop]

(Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)

ELAINE: What do you got, a cucumber?

GEORGE: Yeah, so what?

ELAINE: You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?

GEORGE: They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.

JERRY: (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.

(Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?

ELAINE: No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."

JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?

ELAINE: (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?

GEORGE: Let me see that. (Studies the note)

ELAINE: Hey, where's Kramer?

JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"

GEORGE: (Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.

JERRY: I don't think that's it.

GEORGE: I'm not kidding.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.

JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.

GEORGE: Tightness..

JERRY: C'mon.

GEORGE: Shortness of breath..

JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous.

GEORGE: Radiating waves of pain..

JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.

GEORGE: There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.

JERRY: (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.

GEORGE: Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.

JERRY: So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?

GEORGE: Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.

JERRY: I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)

(A waitress approaches. George is dying, but the waitress doesn't seem to notice)

WAITRESS: Is everything alright?

GEORGE: We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..

ELAINE: George!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Hospital room]

(George lies in the bed. He has EKG cups on his chest, a tube up his nose, and an IV in his arm. The man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain)

MAN: Ooohhh... Argghhh..

GEORGE: Are.. are you okay?

MAN: Ooooooohhh..

GEORGE: I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-

MAN: Shut up!

(Scene goes to Jerry. He's standing at the doorway, showing the note to a nurse)

JERRY: Well? What do you think?

NURSE 1: "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.

JERRY: "Salami salami bologna"?

DOCTOR: (In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?

GEORGE: No, no thanks.

JERRY: (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?

GEORGE: Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.

JERRY: Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..

GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.

JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..

JERRY: Well, you know..

GEORGE: (Reluctantly) Well, okay.

JERRY: Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?

GEORGE: Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..

JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.

GEORGE: I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?

JERRY: You know, if your future was a little more certain..

GEORGE: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.

JERRY: Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)

GEORGE: What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!

(Elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George)

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Jerk off.

(Jerry goes over to Elaine)

JERRY: (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.

(They both go to George's bed. Elaine decides to go along with Jerry's joke)

ELAINE: Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?

(Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George)

GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!

(The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance)

DOCTOR: (To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.

DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.

GEORGE: (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!

DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack.

GEORGE: (Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?

DOCTOR: No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.

GEORGE: Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.

DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far.

GEORGE: (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!

DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?

GEORGE: My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.

DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)

DOCTOR: It happens.

JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.

ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.

DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.

JERRY: (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.

GEORGE: (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!

DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.

GEORGE: What? You mean with a knife?

DOCTOR: Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.

GEORGE: (Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.

DOCTOR: Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.

ELAINE: (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)

JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.

(Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.

JERRY: (Trying to shut him up) Kramer.

KRAMER: The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.

JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.

KRAMER: No? That's good.

GEORGE: I have to have my tonsils taken out.

KRAMER: Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.

JERRY: (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.

KRAMER: Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..

GEORGE: Well, what should I do, Kramer?

JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him.

KRAMER: I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.

JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time?

KRAMER: No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.

JERRY: A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.

KRAMER: He's holistic, George. He's holistic.

GEORGE: Holistic.. that sounds right.

JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?

JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.

GEORGE: Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?

KRAMER: First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Healer's apartment]

(Jerry and George are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor. Kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model)

GEORGE: So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?

JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.

GEORGE: All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.

JERRY: (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.

GEORGE: Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?

(Tor enters. He hugs Kramer for a long time, then walks over to Jerry and George)

TOR: (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?

JERRY: Sorry.

(Tor sits down, and turns tward George)

TOR: What month were you born?

GEORGE: April.

TOR: You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.

GEORGE: Really?

TOR: Do you use hot water in the shower?

GEORGE: Yes.

TOR: Stop using it.

GEORGE: ..Okay.

KRAMER: I'm off hot water.

TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.

GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.

TOR: (Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.

GEORGE: (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?

TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.

JERRY: (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.

GEORGE: (Still on the hot water) What about shaving?

TOR: (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)

GEORGE: I guess so.

TOR: (Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.

JERRY: (Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..

TOR: You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.

GEORGE: (Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?

JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Doctor's car]

(The Doctor and Elaine are almost done with their date. the doctor is speaking seductively to Elaine while holding out her tongue)

DOCTOR: ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..

(The Doctor is still holding her tongue)

ELAINE: Uh-huh.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Healer's apartment]

TOR: (Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.

JERRY: I love crampbark.

TOR: Cleavers.

JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.

TOR: And some couchgrass.

JERRY: Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.

(Tor hands George the tea. George isn't willing to drink it right away. Jerry looks skeptical, Kramer, on the other hand, is enthusiastic)

KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-

TOR: (Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. "Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)

KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

GEORGE: (Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Ambulance]

(George's strapped down on a gurney. His face is purple, and he's screaming. Jerry and Kramer are trying to calm him down. The driver and the assistant in the back are having a huge fight)

GEORGE: (In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!

DRIVER: (To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!

ASSISTANT: I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!

DRIVER: I don't even like Chuckles!

JERRY: (To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.

GEORGE: My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!

ASSISTANT: I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!

JERRY: (To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?

ASSISTANT: (Angry, to Driver) Pull over!

DRIVER: Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!

ASSISTANT: Yeah!

JERRY: You're gonna fight?

GEORGE: Now?! I'm a mutant!

KRAMER: (To Driver) Hey, let me drive.

ASSISTANT: Come on, man. Pull over!

DRIVER: Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!

(Ambulance comes to a screeching halt. Driver gets out, and the assistant heads for the back door)

JERRY: (Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.

GEORGE: My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!

ASSISTANT: I'm gonna kick his ass.

KRAMER: (To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?

GEORGE: You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!

(The Assistant leaves. Jerry, Kramer, and George watch the two fight)

JERRY: All this for a Chuckle.

KRAMER: What's a Chuckle?

JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Doctor's car]

(He's still holding Elaine's tongue)

DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.

ELAINE: Can you let go of my tongue now?

DOCTOR: What?

ELAINE: Let go of my tongue!

DOCTOR: (Lets go) Oh, sorry.

ELAINE: Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?

DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night.

ELAINE: A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Ambulance]

(It's now moving. The driver's behind the wheel, but the assistant is nowhere in sight)

JERRY: You just can't leave him out there.

DRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up.

KRAMER: Well, can you call him an ambulance?

DRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!

KRAMER: hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!

DRIVER: (Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!

JERRY AND KRAMER: Watch out!

(The Ambulance crashes into something)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Hospital room]

(George is in the bed, watching TV, wearing a neck brace. Jerry enters limping and wearing a neck brace, also. He talks to George, but George can't respond verbally)

JERRY: How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.

(Nurse enters)

JERRY: Hey, check the TV.

(The TV is showing the same exact movie Jerry was watching at the start of the show)

TV VOICE: (Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..

JERRY: (Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.

MAN IN NEIGHBORING BED: Shut up!

(George throws the whole carton of ice cream over the separating curtan)

MAN: Aaahhhgggg!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"

I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, "What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.



[While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.]

JERRY: What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?

ELAINE: Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?

JERRY: He was good in Man From Uncle.

ELAINE: Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?

JERRY: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.

ELAINE: Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.

JERRY: No, I don't wanna see the naked people.

ELAINE: Been a while?

JERRY: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.

ELAINE: I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.

JERRY: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What was that look?

JERRY: What look?

ELAINE: The look you just gave me.

JERRY: I gave a look?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: What kind of look?

ELAINE: I know that look.

JERRY: Then what was it?

ELAINE: Why should I tell you?

JERRY: Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.

ELAINE: Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What about the look?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: You got something on your mind?

JERRY: No. Things pop into your head. You?

ELAINE: Things occur to me from time to time.

JERRY: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.

ELAINE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?

ELAINE: Thirty-seven.

JERRY: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)

ELAINE: We know the terrain.

JERRY: No big surprises.

ELAINE: Nope.

JERRY: What do you think?

ELAINE: I don't know. What do you think?

JERRY: Well, it's something to consider.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: I mean, let's say we did.

ELAINE: What if.

JERRY: Is that like the end of the world or something?

ELAINE: Certainly not.

JERRY: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.

ELAINE: It's almost stupid if we didn't.

JERRY: It's moronic.

ELAINE: Absurd!

JERRY: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.

ELAINE: We, there are always a few.

JERRY: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.

ELAINE: Devastating.

JERRY: Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)

ELAINE: And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)

JERRY: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.

ELAINE: Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.

JERRY: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.

ELAINE: Huh.

JERRY: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.

ELAINE: Right.

JERRY: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.

ELAINE: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.

JERRY: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.

ELAINE: All right, sir.

JERRY: Now here's another little rule.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.

ELAINE: Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!

JERRY: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.

ELAINE: What about the kiss goodnight?

JERRY: Tough one. You're call.

ELAINE: It's brug-wa (?).

JERRY: Fine. Well.

ELAINE: Well.

JERRY: You ready?

ELAINE: Ready.

JERRY: So think you can handle this?

ELAINE: Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)



[Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Got the paper?

JERRY: Not yet.

KRAMER: No paper?

JERRY: I haven't been out yet.

KRAMER: Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)



[George and Jerry at Monk's.]

GEORGE: What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?

JERRY: No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?

GEORGE: Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?

JERRY: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.

GEORGE: Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.

JERRY: I thought you'd like that.

GEORGE: Oh, this is huge!

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: All right, okay. Let's go, details.

JERRY: No, I can't do details.

GEORGE: You wha?

JERRY: I can't give details.

GEORGE: No details?

JERRY: I'm not in the mood.

GEORGE: You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!

JERRY: All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.

GEORGE: Where are you sitting?

JERRY: On the couch.

GEORGE: Next to each other?

JERRY: No, separated.

GEORGE: Time?

JERRY: Around eleven.

GEORGE: Okay, go ahead.

JERRY: So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.

GEORGE: Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.

JERRY: And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.

GEORGE: Boy, these are really bad details.

JERRY: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.

GEORGE: Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.

JERRY: Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.

GEORGE: Better than before?

JERRY: She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.

GEORGE: This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?

JERRY: Not exactly.

GEORGE: Not exactly. What does that mean?

JERRY: Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)

GEORGE: Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
(He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.

JERRY: I think we've worked out a system.

GEORGE: Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.

JERRY: No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.

GEORGE: Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.

JERRY: Okay. No calls the next day.

GEORGE: (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.

JERRY: You ready for the second one?

GEORGE: I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.

JERRY: Spending the night. Optional.

GEORGE: No, you see? You got greedy.

JERRY: No, that's the rule. It's optional.

GEORGE: I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.

JERRY: I think you're wrong.

GEORGE: I hope I am.



[At Elaine's apartment, Jerry opens the fridge and pulls out a piece of cake.]

JERRY: Is this yours or the roommate's?

ELAINE: The roommate's.

JERRY: Would she mind?

ELAINE: She keeps track of everything.

JERRY: Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.

ELAINE: Thanks.

JERRY: Well, guess I'll get going.

ELAINE: Oh.

JERRY: Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.

ELAINE: Fine, go away.

JERRY: I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.

ELAINE: Just go.

JERRY: I'm having surgery tomorrow.

ELAINE: Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.

JERRY: But you said, it can be very serious.

ELAINE: Okay, so fine. Go.

JERRY: What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.

ELAINE: Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.

JERRY: It has nothing to do with whose house it is.

ELAINE: Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)

Tina: Hi.

Elaine + JERRY: Hi.

Tina: Hi, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi.

Tina: Such a great improv class tonight.

ELAINE: Oh really?

Tina: I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.

ELAINE: Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?

Tina: Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)

ELAINE: What are you doing?

JERRY: I can't go if you're mad.

ELAINE: I'm not mad.

JERRY: You seemed a little mad.

ELAINE: No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.

JERRY: So you're okay with everything?

ELAINE: Definitely. Are you?

JERRY: Definitely. Well, goodnight.

ELAINE: Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Rules.

Tina: Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)



[Jerry and George are at the store.]

GEORGE: What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.

JERRY: No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.

GEORGE: Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.

JERRY: No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.

GEORGE: What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?

JERRY: You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.

GEORGE: What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.

JERRY: I think I heard her say something about a bench.

GEORGE: A bench? What kind of a bench?

JERRY: I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.

GEORGE: What, like at a bus stop?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: Like a park bench?

JERRY: I have no idea.

GEORGE: Who puts a bench in their house?

JERRY: Forget the bench.

GEORGE: I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?

JERRY: No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.

GEORGE: Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.

JERRY: Nice looking fellow.

GEORGE: What about candle holders?

JERRY: Too romantic.

GEORGE: Lingerie?

JERRY: Too sexual.

GEORGE: Waffle maker.

JERRY: Too domestic.

GEORGE: Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.

JERRY: Too Gubernatorial. (?)

GEORGE: Let's work on the card.


[Jerry and Elaine sitting on his couch. Elaine holding a present.]

JERRY: Maybe you won't like it.

ELAINE: Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.

JERRY: You could not like it.

ELAINE: Just the fact that you remembered means everything.

JERRY: Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)

ELAINE: Cash?

JERRY: Would do you think?

ELAINE: You got me cash?

JERRY: Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?

ELAINE: Who are you, my uncle?

JERRY: Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.

ELAINE: Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)

ELAINE: Pal? You think I'm your pal?

JERRY: I said, "and more."

ELAINE: I am not your pal.

JERRY: What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)

ELAINE: Oh, what is this? You got me something?

KRAMER: Yeah. Open it.

ELAINE: Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)

KRAMER: That's pretty good, huh?

JERRY: Great.

KRAMER: Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.

JERRY: Well goody for you.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?

JERRY: 182 bucks.

KRAMER: Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.

ELAINE: (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.

KRAMER: (To Jerry) Yates.

ELAINE: Oh Kramer. (They embrace)

JERRY: Could you excuse us please?

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: We're talking.

KRAMER: Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)

JERRY: You know, we never had one fight before this deal.

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: Never.

ELAINE: Ever.

JERRY: We got along beautifully.

ELAINE: Like clams.

JERRY: It was wonderful.

ELAINE: A pleasure.

JERRY: So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.

ELAINE: I can't do it.

JERRY: You what?

ELAINE: I can't do that.

JERRY: You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?

ELAINE: This, that, and the other.

JERRY: Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?

ELAINE: You.

JERRY: (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...


[Jerry and George at Monk's.]

GEORGE: Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.

JERRY: I never should have made up those rules.

GEORGE: What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?

JERRY: It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.

GEORGE: You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.

JERRY: What did you end up giving her?

GEORGE: 91 dollars.

JERRY: Sorry about that.

GEORGE: So what're you gonna do?

JERRY: Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.

GEORGE: So, maybe this should be it.

JERRY: Could be it.

GEORGE: She seems like an it.

JERRY: She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...

GEORGE: We'd have to kill him.

JERRY: We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.

GEORGE: I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.

JERRY: Plus, you know what else.

GEORGE: You better call her.


[Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: You got the paper yet?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?

ELAINE: No.

KRAMER: Well, you're not reading it now.

ELAINE: All right, you can take it. But I want it back.

KRAMER: Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?

ELAINE: Ah, this. And that.

JERRY: And the other.

KRAMER: Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple.

JERRY: Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Coffee shop]

GEORGE: (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.

JERRY: She's the performance artist, right?

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.

JERRY: What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?

ELAINE: Todd.

JERRY: Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.

ELAINE: No, he's not.

JERRY: C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.

ELAINE: By marriage.

JERRY: Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.

GEORGE: That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.

ELAINE: Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

GEORGE: What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?

JERRY: Thin ice, George. Thin ice..

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.

ELAINE: She stopped performing.

GEORGE: (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.

JERRY: (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

GEORGE: She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".

JERRY: Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?

GEORGE: God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.

ELAINE: It was an accident!

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"

JERRY: (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.

GEORGE: And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.

JERRY: What ever happened with the shirt?

GEORGE: I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.

ELAINE: I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.

JERRY: Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?

ELAINE: anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.

GEORGE: Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.

JERRY: Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.

GEORGE: (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.

ELAINE: Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..

GEORGE: She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!

ELAINE: (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.

GEORGE: Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.

ELAINE: See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..

JERRY: But?

ELAINE: My roommate has Lyme disease.

JERRY: Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?

ELAINE: She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.

JERRY: How did she get Lyme disease?

ELAINE: I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.

JERRY: They still do that play?

ELAINE: It's a classic.

JERRY: With all the nudity?

ELAINE: I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.

GEORGE: (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!

JERRY: Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.

ELAINE: What do you wanna know?

JERRY: Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?

ELAINE: Rarely.

JERRY: There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: When is this suppose to be?

ELAINE: Saturday.

JERRY: Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?

ELAINE: I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.

JERRY: 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.

GEORGE: Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.

JERRY: And if you do?

GEORGE: I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's TV's not giving a clear picture. He messes with the dials as Kramer looks over his shoulder)

KRAMER: What are you doing this for? Look at you..

JERRY: Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.

KRAMER: But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.

JERRY: (Pleading) Leave me alone.

KRAMER: It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!

JERRY: I'm not getting illegal cable!

KRAMER: Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.

JERRY: No, I read in the paper..

KRAMER: (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..

JERRY: Well, they might hook us up again.

KRAMER: Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!

JERRY: Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.

KRAMER: Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!

JERRY: What you're suggesting is illegal.

KRAMER: It's not illegal.

JERRY: It's against the law.

KRAMER: Well, yeah.

JERRY: (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?

KRAMER: (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.

JERRY: A real human rights nut, huh?

KRAMER: Yeah. He's intense, man.

JERRY: I don't know. What if I get caught?

KRAMER: Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.

(Kramer drops the rabbit ears, and goes to his apartment. He then returns with a Russian cable guy - Anatoly Tabachnick, and his assistant. Tabachnick mumbles, shakes, laughs, then wanders around the apartment. Jerry looks confused)

JERRY: You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.

TABACHNICK: Tomarrow okay.

KRAMER: No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.

JERRY: (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..

KRAMER: No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..

JERRY: (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.

KRAMER: You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry enters carrying luggage. A group of nem in suits are waiting for him)

MAN: Mr. Steinfeld?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

MAN: We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?

JERRY: My cable hook-up? What about it?

MAN: It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.

JERRY: It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?

(An agent leads Kramer out of the bedroom into the living room)

KRAMER: Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.

MAN: You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.

JERRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.

(Tabachnick steps out of the bedroom. He's dressed like the other FBI men, and speaks without an accent now)

TABACHNICK: Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.

(Jerry looks around for an excape, then makes a mad dash for the door)

KRAMER: No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Airplane]

(Jerry shudders when looking back on his dream. A stewardess approaches)

JERRY: Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?

STEWARDESS: I'm afraid not.

JERRY: What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?

STEWARDESS: No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?

(The passenger, Bill, next to him offers his hand)

BILL: My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."

(Scene ends)



[Setting: George's car]

(George is driving while wearing an unzipped coat, and a sweater with a bright red collar under it. Jerry's riding shotgun)

GEORGE: Sounds like a rough trip.

JERRY: Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.

GEORGE: So, the college cancelled the gig?

JERRY: Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.

GEORGE: (Modestly) Forget it.

JERRY: No, really.. an airport run.

GEORGE: It's nothing.

JERRY: Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.

JERRY: (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.

GEORGE: (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.

JERRY: Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.

GEORGE: (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.

GEORGE: My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.

JERRY: You want to get a bite?

GEORGE: Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.

JERRY: Well, so what should we do?

GEORGE: Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?

(Jerry's suddenly suspicious. He notices George's red collar, then reaches over and pulls the sweater down)

JERRY: Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!

GEORGE: (Nervous) What are you talking about?

JERRY: You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

GEORGE: I am? What a strange coincidence..

JERRY: A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..

GEORGE: (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.

JERRY: What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?

GEORGE: No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Leslie is talking to a group of people, including Elaine)

LESLIE: We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.

ELAINE: So, where's Todd?

LESLIE: Up in Hyannisport.

ELAINE: Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!

WOMAN: (To Leslie) So, when's your due date?

LESLIE: March twentieth, nine a.m.

WOMAN: You know the time!

LESLIE: I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.

ELAINE: Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?

LESLIE: (Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

(Kramer bursts through the door, followed by Tabachnick and his assistant. Tabachnick looks over a woman, and nods approvingly. The woman freeze at the sight, then disperse nervously)

ELAINE: (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?

KRAMER: We're putting in cable.

ELAINE: The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!

KRAMER: Oh, we have to do this now.

(Tabachnick and his assistant are leering at the women)

ELAINE: Who's this guy?

KRAMER: Which one?

ELAINE: Both of the them.

KRAMER: Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.

ELAINE: Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?

KRAMER: Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.

ELAINE: You can't! You can't do this now!

KRAMER: Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.

ELAINE: Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.

KRAMER: (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: George's car]

JERRY: And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?

GEORGE: (Boiling) What am I going to say?!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!

JERRY: You'll never say that to her face.

GEORGE: Watch me.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.

ELAINE: (To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?

(Tabachnick and his assistant start to argue, then they start fighting)

ELAINE: Kramer!

KRAMER: (Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..

(Everyone's watching the fight. Kramer breaks it up. Tabachnick walks to the bathroom while his assistant returns to work. Tabachnick bangs on the door, and shouts in Russian. A woman finally gets out. Tabachnick gets into the bathroom and slams the door shut. Jerry and George enter. Elaine runs up to greet them)

ELAINE: What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.

JERRY: The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.

ELAINE: I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.

(Leslie approaches them)

LESLIE: Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town.

JERRY: Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.

ELAINE: (Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!

GEORGE: (Unconvincingly coy) About what?

TABACHNICK: (Sticks his head out the door) Kramer, Kramer, Kramer..

(Kramer rushes over, and quickly closes the bathroom door as Tabachnick joins his assistant at the food table. George is ready for Leslie - he takes off his sweater, revealing the chocolate stain. He walks over to Leslie)

GEORGE: Leslie.

LESLIE: Yeah?

GEORGE: George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.

LESLIE: Hi.

GEORGE: (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?

LESLIE: Vaguely.

GEORGE: You took me to one of your shows..

LESLIE: And?

GEORGE: And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..

(Scene cuts to Jerry)

MARY: Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me?

JERRY: I'm sorry, I..

MARY: (Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.

JERRY: (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..

MARY: Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.

JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..

MARY: Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!

JERRY: No, I don't think that..

MARRY: Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!

(She feigns, spitting on the floor near Jerry's shoes, and storms out. Scene cuts to George. Leslie's bored to death)

GEORGE: Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..

(Mary runs for the door, pushing Leslie into George. Her chocolate cake is now all over George's shirt)

LESLIE: Thanks a lot!

(Scene cuts to the front door. Elaine is saying goodbye to a few women who are rushing out the door)

ELAINE: I'm sorry you have to go.

WOMAN: Yeah. I really have to be going.

(Scene cuts to Jerry. He notices the cable guys)

JERRY: Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.

KRAMER: Don't be a fool.

TABACHNICK: You don't want?

JERRY: No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..

TABACHNICK: (Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!

(Scene cuts to Elaine by the door. Leslie has her coat on, and is ready to leave)

LESLIE: I'm going.. obviously.

ELAINE: Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..

LESLIE: Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.

ELAINE: (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?

LESLIE: (Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go!

(George comes out from the bedroom, carrying all the shower gifts - embarrassed)

GEORGE: (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)

JERRY: (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's TV screen is cracked. George and Elaine are slumped on chairs)

GEORGE: Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?

ELAINE: Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.

JERRY: Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?

KRAMER: (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."

JERRY: (A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"



[Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant]

ELAINE: No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.

GEORGE: Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.

JERRY: I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.

ELAINE: You should run for mayor.

JERRY: Ehh, nobody listens.

ELAINE: Where is someone? I'm starving.

GEORGE: I think this is him right here.

ELAINE: Is there a table ready?

RESTAURANT MANAGER (BRUCE): How many?

ELAINE (to Jerry): How many?

JERRY (to George): Is Tatiana coming?

GEORGE: I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.

JERRY: Really? I thought things were going OK.

GEORGE: They were, it's kinda complicated.

JERRY: Well what is it?

ELAINE: How many?

JERRY: Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.

BRUCE: Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.

GEORGE: What do you wanna do?

ELAINE: Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.

JERRY: We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.

GEORGE: I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?

JERRY (to Elaine): Tatiana...

(George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)

GEORGE: Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?

(guy on phone just turns the other way without answering)

BRUCE: Lashbrook, 4!

JERRY: So did I do a terrible thing?

ELAINE: You mean lying to your uncle?

JERRY: I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!

GEORGE (to Jerry): You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.

ELAINE: Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.

JERRY: Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.

GEORGE: He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.

ELAINE: Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?

JERRY: Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.

ELAINE: Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.

GEORGE: I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?

(Jerry stares at someone)

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?

ELAINE: I've never seen her before.

JERRY: I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.

(a group of people comes in, one of them bumps into Elaine)

MAN: Oh, Excuse me.

ELAINE: I'm sorry.

(the group just walks right into the dining room)

ELAINE: Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.

JERRY: Well maybe they were here from before.

ELAINE: No no no, they weren't here before.

GEORGE (to guy): Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.

(guy on phone turns away again)

ELAINE: Find out what's going on!

JERRY: Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.

ELAINE: Yeah.

BRUCE: What's your name?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

(Bruce starts talking to a Chinese woman in Chinese)

BRUCE: No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!

ELAINE: Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.

JERRY: Boy, you are really hungry.

GEORGE (whistles to guy on phone): Hey!

(guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, goes over to Jerry)

GEORGE: If anything happens here, can I count on you?

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: If we decide to go at it.

JERRY: Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...

GEORGE: I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.

ELAINE: I'm gonna faint...

JERRY: George, who is that woman in the stripes?

GEORGE: I don't know her.

JERRY: She looks so familiar.

ELAINE: Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.

JERRY: I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.

ELAINE: What do you mean?

JERRY: You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.

GEORGE: What are they gonna do?

JERRY: They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.

ELAINE: 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?

JERRY: 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.

ELAINE: OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...

JERRY: No, no tricks.

ELAINE: Should I do it, George?

GEORGE: For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.

(Elaine goes over to the table, smiling)

ELAINE (through her teeth): I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.

(the people at the table are confused)

ELAINE (through teeth): I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

PEOPLE AT TABLE: What? What is she talking about? What did she say?

(Elaine runs from the table, laughing)

JERRY: What happened?

ELAINE: Did you see that?

GEORGE: What were you doing?

ELAINE (laughing): I offered them 25, they had no idea...

JERRY: George, the phone's free.

GEORGE: Alleluia.

(as George reaches for the phone, a woman snatches it and starts dialing)

GEORGE: Excuse me, I was waiting here.

WOMAN AT PHONE: Where? I didn't see you.

GEORGE: I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!

WOMAN: Well I won't be long.

GEORGE: That's not the point. The point is I was here first.

WOMAN: Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.

GEORGE (yelling at her): You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.

(he goes over to Jerry and Elaine)

GEORGE: Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!

(guy on phone approaches George)

GUY: Hey, sorry I took so long.

GEORGE: Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.

ELAINE: How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.

JERRY: I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?

GEORGE: Yeah, well, he probably bought it.

JERRY: So what happened with Tatiana?

GEORGE: I shouldn't even tell you this.

JERRY: Come on...

GEORGE: Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.

JERRY: I'm with you.

GEORGE: Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...

JERRY: This could only happen to you.

GEORGE: So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".

JERRY: You said this to her after.

GEORGE: No. During.

JERRY: Oh, boy.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Wow! So...?

GEORGE: So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's

(gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.

(Elaine comes over)

ELAINE: I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.

JERRY (still trying to remember): Who is that woman?!

ELAINE: Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.

GEORGE: She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)

ELAINE: Jerry, talk to that guy again.

JERRY: What am I gonna say?

ELAINE: Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.

(as Jerry approaches Bruce, a man walks in)

MR. COHEN: Hey, what stinks in here?

Bruce (laughing): Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.

MR. COHEN: Well, I've been looking for a better place.

(Bruce laughs)

BRUCE: Better place... Want a table?

MR. COHEN: No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.

BRUCE (laughing): Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table.

JERRY: Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.

BRUCE: Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.

ELAINE: He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?

BRUCE: Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.

ELAINE: Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!

GEORGE: She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.

JERRY: Didja leave a message?

GEORGE: Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.

ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...

JERRY: Where do I know her?

(woman in stripes approaches Jerry)

LORRAINE: Hello, Jerry!

JERRY: Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?

LORRAINE: How is everything?

JERRY: Good, good, good... What's goin' on?

LORRAINE: Oh, working hard. And you?

JERRY: Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.

LORRAINE: You haven't been around in a while.

JERRY: I know, I know... Well, you know.

LORRAINE: You should come by.

JERRY: Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.

ELAINE: Hi, I'm Elaine.

LORRAINE (shaking her hand): Lorraine. Catalano.

JERRY: I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...

(They all laugh, then silent)

LORRAINE: Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she leaves)

ELAINE (smug): Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!

JERRY: Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.

ELAINE: The one you broke the plans with tonight?

JERRY: Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...

JERRY: ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.

ELAINE: You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.

JERRY: Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!

(Elaine nods)

JERRY: Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.

ELAINE: Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.

JERRY: In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?

ELAINE: Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.

GEORGE: 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?

ELAINE: Well what do you want to give him, change?

GEORGE: It's more than the meal!

JERRY: Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.

GEORGE: Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!

JERRY: I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?

GEORGE: Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.

ELAINE: I guess it's you, Jer.

JERRY: Me? What about you?

ELAINE: Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.

JERRY: The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?

ELAINE: Give me the money.

(Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention)

ELAINE: How's it going'?

BRUCE: Very busy.

(Elaine holds the money in front of Bruce)

ELAINE: Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.

BRUCE: Very good specials tonight.

(Elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book)

ELAINE: If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.

BRUCE: What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)

ELAINE: No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)

BRUCE: Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.

ELAINE (Gives him the money): Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!

(Bruce shrugs and takes it)

BRUCE: Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.

ELAINE: No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.

JERRY: You lost the 20.

ELAINE: Well, how could he do that?

GEORGE: You didn't make it clear.

ELAINE: Make it clear?

JERRY: What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.

(goes over to Bruce) Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely embarrassing, my friend here apparently made a mistake.

BRUCE: Your name?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

BRUCE: Yeah, Seinfeld 4!

JERRY: No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?

(Elaine waves at him, smiling)

BRUCE: Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?

JERRY: Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.

BRUCE: Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-

JERRY: Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?

BRUCE: Oh. In about five, ten minutes.

(Jerry goes over to Elaine and George)

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.

ELAINE: So when are we gonna eat?

JERRY: Five, ten minutes.

GEORGE: We should have left earlier. I told you.

JERRY: I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.

ELAINE: Oh, well I have to eat.

JERRY: Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.

ELAINE: Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?

JERRY: We'll eat it in the movie.

ELAINE: Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?

JERRY: Well what do you suggest?

ELAINE: I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.

JERRY: I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.

BRUCE (holding a phone): Cartwright?

ELAINE: I can't have popcorn for dinner!

BRUCE: Cartwright?

ELAINE (tries to snatch food off a waiter's tray): I have to eat!

JERRY: So they have hotdogs there.

ELAINE: Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.

GEORGE: I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.

(goes over to Bruce)

GEORGE: Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

BRUCE: Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up.

GEORGE: Well, was it for Costanza or...

BRUCE: Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.

GEORGE: Well was it a woman?

BRUCE: Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.

(George comes over to Jerry and Elaine, stunned)

GEORGE: She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.

JERRY: Who's Cartwright?

GEORGE: I'm Cartwright!

JERRY: You're not Cartwri-

GEORGE: Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.

ELAINE: Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.

JERRY: So You're not going?

ELAINE: You don't need us.

JERRY: Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

GEORGE: Should we tell him we're leaving?

ELAINE: What for? Let's just get out of here.

(they all leave)

BRUCE: Seinfeld, 4?



[closing monologue]

JERRY: Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"

JERRY: I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: A restaurant]

(Jerry, George, and Elaine are all eating at an Italian restaurant. George hasn't eaten anything)

ELAINE: Do you want some of mine?

JERRY: Take some of mine.

GEORGE: Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.

JERRY: Who said you have to like it?

GEORGE: Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.

JERRY: I don't like pesto.

GEORGE: Where was pesto 10 years ago?

JERRY: (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.

ELAINE: (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.

(George has started eating Elaine's food - and continues to do so)

JERRY: (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.

GEORGE: That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.

JERRY: I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.

GEORGE: A guy?

ELAINE: (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.

JERRY: He's from a.. Yakima, right?

ELAINE: Seattle.

JERRY: Everybody's moving to Seattle.

GEORGE: It's the pesto of cities. So..?

ELAINE: (To Jerry) You tell him.

JERRY: Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.

ELAINE: Ed.

JERRY: Who was in town on a business venture, and um..

ELAINE: ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.

JERRY: So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.

ELAINE: On some people.

GEORGE: Oooh.

JERRY: So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.

ELAINE: It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.

(The menu at a neighboring table catches fire. Elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out, but George tosses the menu on the floor, and stomps it out. The manager approaches)

MANAGER: What happened?

GEORGE: Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.

MANAGER: Sorry to the disturbance.

ELAINE: (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.

(Manager leaves)

JERRY: (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.

GEORGE: Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!

ELAINE: I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.

JERRY: (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.

(The busboy takes of his apron, throws it down, and exits the restaurant)

GEORGE: I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!

ELAINE: Oh, I said it in a kidding way.

GEORGE: I didn't know he'd get fired.

JERRY: (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.

GEORGE: What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!

JERRY: (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.

GEORGE: Was it my fault?

ELAINE: Was it my fault?

JERRY: (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.

GEORGE: (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.

JERRY: Oh, like you do.

GEORGE: Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.

JERRY: (Scoffing) Camp.

GEORGE: It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.

(The intercom buzzes, Jerry talks through it)

JERRY: Elaine?

ELAINE: (Through intercom) Yeah.

(Jerry pushes a button on the intercom - letting her in)

JERRY: Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.

GEORGE: Then why don't you try and get him another job?

JERRY: I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.

GEORGE: What? Did you get the busboy's number?

ELAINE: His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?

(Jerry hands the car keys to Elaine)

GEORGE: How did you get all this?

ELAINE: Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?

JERRY: No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.

GEORGE: (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.

JERRY: You, you're going now?

GEORGE: Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.

JERRY: Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?

ELAINE: I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.

JERRY: I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?

GEORGE: It'll take to long.

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: Take the K-man. A little support..

GEORGE: (Unsure) I don't a..

KRAMER: Take me where? Where?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: An apartment building hallway]

(George's nervous - standing with Kramer infront of the busboy's apartment)

GEORGE: Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.

KRAMER: What am I gonna say?

GEORGE: I don't know.

KRAMER: Well, I'm not an idiot.

GEORGE: Certainly not.

KRAMER: Then we're cool.

GEORGE: Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.

KRAMER: (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.

GEORGE: This is a guy I know.. Kramer.

(Antonio, the busboy, is watching them suspiciously)

KRAMER: ¿Habla espanol?

GEORGE: (To himself) Oh my God.

ANTONIO: Si.

KRAMER: ¿Como se dice.. waterbed?

GEORGE: (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.

KRAMER: You got anything to drink? ¿Agua?

GEORGE: Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.

KRAMER: Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)

GEORGE: Hurry up.

ANTONIO: (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)

KRAMER: His cat's gone.

ANTONIO: (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Antonio's apartment]

(All three sit in silence)

KRAMER: ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in

their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you gotta worry about.

GEORGE: (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.

KRAMER: The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.

GEORGE: (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)

KRAMER: You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.

KRAMER: It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.

JERRY: (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.

KRAMER: Oh? How do you figure?

JERRY: (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.

KRAMER: Why was I in charge of closing the door?

JERRY: (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!

KRAMER: So!

JERRY: (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!

KRAMER: Let me talk to him.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)

ELAINE: Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?

(Jerry pitches her the keys as she goes some tward his bathroom)

JERRY: No hello?

ELAINE: Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?

JERRY: Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.

ELAINE: Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.

JERRY: (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?

ELAINE: I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?

JERRY: There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?

ELAINE: Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!

JERRY: So, you two been, uh..

ELAIEN: No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..

JERRY: What's your airport route?

ELAINE: I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.

JERRY: ..What about the Van Wyck?

ELAINE: I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

JERRY: Oooh.

ELAINE: Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?

JERRY: You still using that old alarm clock?

ELAIEN: Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Elaine's apartment]

(Elaine and Ed are in bed. Elaine awakes to find out that it's 9:15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)

ELAINE: (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!

ED: 9:15?

ELAINE: Yes! 9:15!

ED: (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.

ELAINE: Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!

ED: Can I shower?

ELAINE: Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!

ED: I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

ELAINE: Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?

ED: The kitchen.

ELAINE: The kitchen?!

ED: I've got a bag of cashews in there.

ELAINE: They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!

ED: What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.

ELAINE: No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!

ED: I'll never make it.

ELAINE: Don't say that!

ED: But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.

ELAINE: Shut up and pack!

ED: And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?

ELAINE: You're talking too much!

ED: Where's my sweater?

ELAINE: What?!

ED: My brown sweater.

ELAINE: What? What sweater?

ED: My brown sweater.

ELAINE: You didn't bring a brown sweater.

ED: I brought a brown sweater.

ELAINE: Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!

ED: That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.

ELAINE: It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)

ED: What are you doing?!

ELAINE: NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)

ED: My shoes. You packed my shoes.

ELAINE: Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Anywhere in the city?

GEORGE: Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.

JERRY: Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?

GEORGE: Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.

JERRY: Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.

GEORGE: (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.

(Elaine enters. She's still wearing her nightclothes under her coat. Her hair is messed up. She's been through quite an ordeal)

ELAINE: (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!

GEORGE: The busboy's coming?

JERRY: You don't mean here?

KRAMER: Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..

GEORGE: He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.

JERRY: Where are you going?

GEORGE: I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.

JERRY: (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.

KRAMER: No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.

GEORGE: Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..

(There's a knock in the hallway)

KRAMER: Antonio. In here!

(Antonio enters)

GEORGE: (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?

(Antonio crosses over to George, and gives him a hug)

ANTONIO: Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)

GEORGE: (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..

(The intercom buzzes)

ELAINE: (Into the intercom) Yeah?

ED: It's Eddie.

ELAINE: He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..

ANTONIO: And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)

(Everyone ad-libs congratulations to George. Then, we hear a fight erupting from the hallway)

ED: Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!

ANTONIO: Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!

ED: Who do you think you're talking to, pal?

ANTONIO: Hey, get your hands off me!

ED: Go to hell!

(Antonio screams out profanity in Spanish, then we hear them getting into a serious fight)

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Coffee shop]

JERRY: He'll get another job. He's a busboy!

GEORGE: It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.

JERRY: It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.

GEORGE: That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.

ELAINE: Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.

GEORGE: So, much longer?

ELAINE: Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?

GEORGE: (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.

ELAINE: Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)

GEORGE: I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.

JERRY: Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?

(Scene ends)



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.

JERRY: Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."



[Daytime - Exterior of a building then inside to a Massage Room]

(Jerry is getting a massage.)

JULIANNA: ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

JERRY: What do you think the worst part of being blind is?

JULIANNA: Excuse me?

JERRY: You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?

JULIANNA: I don't know.

JERRY: I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.

JULIANNA: Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.

JERRY: You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?

JULIANNA: No.

JERRY: He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.

JULIANNA: Oh.

JERRY: Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.

JULIANNA (visibly uncomfortable): Have you seen any good movies?

JERRY: Who takes care of your boy during the day?

JULIANNA: We have a woman. Why?

JERRY: No no. I'm just saying.

JULIANNA: She had references.

JERRY: Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.

(Julianna pauses to think about what Jerry is saying)

JERRY: (about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.

JULIANNA: I don't live near here, ya know!

(Jerry raises his head up and looks confused.)



[Jerry, Elaine and George are in Jerry's apartment. George is looking through the fridge.]

JERRY: So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.

ELAINE: I don't like to talk during a massage.

JERRY: Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.

GEORGE: Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.

ELAINE: Oh! I forgot to tell you--

JERRY: I'm in the middle of a story.

ELAINE: Oh, okay, go ahead.

GEORGE: Why don't you ever go shopping?

JERRY: Well it’s not like it's a really funny story or anything.

ELAINE: What happened?

JERRY: Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

ELAINE: Oh, wasn't that terrible?

JERRY: Yes, it was.

GEORGE: Not even an apple.

ELAINE: She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.

JERRY: I know it was stupid.

ELAINE: Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)

JERRY: Hey, I just said it was stupid.

GEORGE: What about this leftover Chinese food?

JERRY: Take it.

ELAINE: I can't believe you said that.

JERRY: Hey, would you stop it already?

ELAINE: So, what’d she say?

JERRY: I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.

GEORGE: (he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)

ELAINE: I have a good masseuse you could go to.

JERRY: Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.

(George closes the fridge door and pauses for a second contemplating what he just heard.)

GEORGE: Physical therapy is covered by insurance?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: You don't have to pay for the massage?

JERRY: Not if you have a doctor's note.

ELAINE: So where do you get this note?

JERRY: Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.

GEORGE: Right, your friend Roy.

ELAINE: What's the name of this physical therapist?

JERRY: I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.

GEORGE: And you don't have to pay.

(George and Elaine give each other a “sounds good” look)



[George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office.]

GEORGE: We have a, three-o'clock appointments.

RECEPTIONIST: George and Elaine, right?

ELAINE: Right.

RECEPTIONIST: Could you fill these out for me please? And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna…

ELAINE: (quietly) Ok.

RECEPTIONIST: … And George, you'll be with Raymond.

(George was just about seated when he hears the news, pauses for a second, then stands.)

GEORGE: Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?

RECEPTIONIST: Yes.

GEORGE: But, uh, Raymond is a man.

RECEPTIONIST: That's right.

(George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.)

GEORGE: I can't get a massage from a man.

ELAINE: Why not?

GEORGE: What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.

ELAINE: No, I don't want the man either.

GEORGE: What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.

ELAINE: He'd just be touching your back.

GEORGE: He'd just be touching your back too.

ELAINE: No, it could get sexual.

GEORGE: I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.

ELAINE: I wouldn't be comfortable.

GEORGE: I would? What if something happens?

ELAINE: What could happen?

GEORGE: What if it felt good?

ELAINE: It's supposed to feel good.

GEORGE: I don't want it to feel good.

ELAINE: Then why get the massage?

GEORGE: Exactly!

(They go back to filing out the forms. A man walks up dressed in white.)

RAYMOND: George?

(George looks up, in stages, each time a little higher until he is looking up at Raymond’s face and pauses)

GEORGE: Yes?

RAYMOND: I'm Raymond. (with a big smile)

GEORGE: Hello.(with not a big smile)

RAYMOND: Are you ready? (smiling, he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome Raymond.)

(George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond. Raymond puts his hand on George’s back for a second then removes it. George looks back at Elaine -- she continues to have a huge smile on as she watches them walk down the hallway)



[A shirtless George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George appears extremely uncomfortable.]

RAYMOND: …And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.

GEORGE: Really.

RAYMOND: Use to be a flight attendant.

GEORGE: Oh boy.

RAYMOND: Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.

(George looks back up at Raymond, who is massaging his left hand with his right hand while waiting for George. George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down to his hips. George appears completely startled. Raymond then starts massaging his lower back.)

RAYMOND: So what do you do?

GEORGE: What?

RAYMOND: I said, 'What do you do?'.

GEORGE: I-I don't know.

RAYMOND: You don't know what you do?

GEORGE: Nah.

RAYMOND: Ohh-ho, come on. Hey, you're very tense.

GEORGE: hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).

RAYMOND: Okay, just take off those pants now, and I'll work the hamstring.

GEORGE: Oh, the hamstring’s fine.

RAYMOND: But you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board)

GEORGE: I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.

RAYMOND: I'll check it out. (makes a notation on the form)

GEORGE: Are you sure?

RAYMOND: Yeah, take 'em off. (continues writing)

(George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond rubbing his hands with oil. Raymond has a big smile on his face. Nervous, George takes his pants off, pauses for a second while holding the crumpled pants, he tosses them to the floor. Now dressed in just his boxer shorts and socks he quickly climbs back on the table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid with discomfort.)

RAYMOND: How did you hurt this?

GEORGE: I don't know.

RAYMOND: You don't know?

GEORGE: No.

RAYMOND: But you just told me--

GEORGE: Korea.

RAYMOND: You hurt it in Korea?

GEORGE: What?

RAYMOND: The hamstring.

GEORGE: Korea.

RAYMOND: How?

GEORGE: Hamstring.

RAYMOND: How did you hurt the hamstring?

GEORGE: Hotel.



[Elaine is in the waiting room -- moving her head and neck around she breathes in through her teeth, a sigh of relief. George walks out very slowly, he appears positively shell-shocked.]

ELAINE: How'd it go? George?

(George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.)



[Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.]

JERRY: No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.

(George enters acting nervous.)

JERRY: What's with you?

GEORGE: A... ah...

JERRY: Yes, A...?

GEORGE: A man gave me...

JERRY: Yes, a man gave you...?

GEORGE: A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu…

JERRY: So?

GEORGE: So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh…

JERRY: He was what?!

GEORGE: He-he was uh… touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)

JERRY: That's a massage.

GEORGE: And then I took my pants off.

JERRY: You took your pants off?

GEORGE: For my hamstring.

JERRY: Oh.

GEORGE: He got about uh, two inches from... there.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: I think it moved.

JERRY: Moved?

GEORGE: It may have moved, I don't know.

JERRY: I'm sure it didn't move.

GEORGE: It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.

JERRY: Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.

GEORGE: No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.

JERRY: Okay, so what if it moved?

GEORGE: That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.

JERRY: That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.

GEORGE: You think it's contact? It has to be touched?

JERRY: That's what a gym teacher once told me.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.

JERRY: Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?

KRAMER: Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.

JERRY: No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.

KRAMER: Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.

GEORGE: I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.

JERRY: I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.

KRAMER: Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?

JERRY: He can have a donut,

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: …but not at Dinky.

GEORGE: I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.

KRAMER: Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.

GEORGE: The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.

JERRY: I never said I'd do that.

GEORGE: What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.

JERRY: I don't know how I feel about it.

GEORGE: Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?

JERRY: Alright, alright.

KRAMER: A stall man, huh? (small laugh)

GEORGE: All right -- (Gets up to leave)

KRAMER: Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)



[George and Jerry are in Roy's office.]

JERRY: ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.

GEORGE: He didn't say he can't.

JERRY: I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.

GEORGE: He doesn't feel funny.

JERRY: If he does.

GEORGE: Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.

JERRY: He feels funny. You don't have to do this.

GEORGE: He knows that!

JERRY: Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?

GEORGE: Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

ROY: Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?

GEORGE: How would I know?

ROY: Do you like him?

GEORGE: What do you mean, like him?

ROY: Do you like him?

GEORGE: I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.

ROY: How come you don't like him?

GEORGE: Why should I?

JERRY: What is the matter with you?

GEORGE: Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?

ROY: So, you want the notes?

JERRY: You don't have to, really.

ROY: Nah nah, it's ok.

JERRY: We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?



[Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.]

JERRY: Well what about the week after?

(Jerry sits on the couch, but Elaine is a little too close to the end and he has to squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down)

JERRY: No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)

ELAINE: What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)

(She tries to move, but Jerry is sitting on the edge of her dress. She has to tug on it, then move over.)

JERRY: Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.

ELAINE: Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.

JERRY: Uh huh.

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Joe DiMaggio?

KRAMER: Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.

ELAINE: Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!

KRAMER: That's right.

JERRY: See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

KRAMER: Oh, he's a dunker.

ELAINE: Why couldn't he be a dunker?

KRAMER: And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that he’ll look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.

ELAINE: So then what?

KRAMER: Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.

ELAINE: Why didn't you just call out his name?

(George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee.)

JERRY: What happened to you?

GEORGE: These kids called me a Mary.

ELAINE: A what?

GEORGE: I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.

KRAMER: Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.

ELAINE: Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?

(George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers it, Jerry grabs it from him.)

JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.

KRAMER (singing): ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...

JERRY: I told you.

GEORGE: Told me what?

JERRY: I told you we shouldn't do it.

GEORGE: He didn't say anything.

JERRY: He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.

ELAINE: Three notes?

JERRY: Yeah, you, me and George.

ELAINE: You got me a note?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: But I got my own note.

JERRY: You what?

ELAINE: I got a note from my gynecologist.

JERRY: Why'd you do that?

ELAINE: I didn't know you were getting me a note.

JERRY: Of course I was getting you a note.

ELAINE: But you didn't say anything. Ohhh…

JERRY: Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.

GEORGE: No Doctor--

ELAINE: Wait a--

KRAMER: How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.

(Kramer leaves.)



[Jerry and George are at Roy's office.]

JERRY: Hi Pam.

PAM: Hello.

GEORGE: Hello.

JERRY: I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um…

(Roy walks in.)

ROY: Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.

JERRY: Hi Roy.

GEORGE: How ya doing?

ROY: Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.



[Roy, Jerry and George are talking over a woman sleeping in a dental chair.]

JERRY: I don't even know what to say.

GEORGE: Me neither.

JERRY: I knew this would happen.

GEORGE: Me too.

JERRY: I mean the whole thing, it's just...

GEORGE: Tragic.

JERRY: Well it's not tragic.

GEORGE: No?

JERRY: No, it's...

GEORGE: Unsettling?

JERRY: Okay. I mean, what if the--

(Pam walks in and interrupts.)

PAM: I hope you're both happy. (she turns and walks away)

(Roy looks at Jerry and with his mouth closed -- smiles with his right cheek and frowns with his left cheek.)

JERRY: I'm not happy.

GEORGE: Me neither. I've never been happy.

JERRY: I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.

GEORGE: In college, maybe. Those were fun times.

JERRY: Yeah, college was fun.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah.

(Pam walks in again and interjects.)

PAM: You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that? (she turns and walks away again.)

ROY: Don't mind her.

JERRY: Oh please, I love her.

GEORGE: I've just met her but I'm very impressed.

ROY: I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.

JERRY: Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?

ROY: Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.

JERRY: What? The physical therapist? Why?

ROY: She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.

(The woman in the chair wakes up and looks at Jerry and George.)

GEORGE: How ya doing?



[Jerry and George are at Julianna's office.]

JERRY: Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.

RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not in.

JERRY: Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.

RECEPTIONIST: I told you, she's not here.

JERRY: You don't understand, ah…

RECEPTIONIST: Look, you have to leave.

JERRY: Wait a second, don't you--

(Julianna walks out with her child. When she sees Jerry, she pulls her son in front of her with her arms down on his chest to protect him from Jerry.)

JERRY: Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --

JULIANNA: Please!

JERRY: --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--

JULIANNA: I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!

JERRY: Can't you just listen to me?

JULIANNA (releasing her child): Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! (to the receptionist) Call the police!

(Julianna then runs down the hall.)

JERRY: The police?

(Raymond the masseuse walks up.)

RAYMOND: What is the --. Hi George. (stands there with a big smile)

GEORGE: Hello.

JERRY (to George): Raymond?

(George appears to be very uncomfortable.)



[Jerry, Elaine and George are at the coffee shop.]

ELAINE: Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.

JERRY: Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.

GEORGE: Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.

ELAINE: Of what?

(to Elaine, George makes a “you know” face and rolls his right hand open -- she responds with an equally silent yet somewhat disgusted face that says “Oh.”)

GEORGE: And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"

ELAINE: What do they do?

GEORGE: They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"

(Jerry spots Kramer through the window. He’s talking to a guy in a blue coat.)

JERRY: Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.

(Kramer enters and sits at the booth.)

KRAMER: Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh.… I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.

(All three put down their coffee cups simultaneously.)

JERRY: Did he say anything?

KRAMER: No no, he's fine.

JERRY (noticing something across the coffee shop): Oh my god, it's...

GEORGE (looking over): Joe DiMaggio.

ELAINE: (gasps)

KRAMER: Where?

JERRY: Having a cup of coffee.

(shot of a man in a suit jacket and tie, dunking a donut in a cup of coffee)

ELAINE: And he's dunking!

KRAMER: Yeah -- yeah.

JERRY: Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper…

KRAMER: (quietly) yeah.

JERRY: …here.

GEORGE: You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.

KRAMER: Wait, wait… hold on now, wait, wait… *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.



[Closing monologue.]

JERRY: What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"

JERRY: Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...



[Monks]

PATRICE: Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats

GEORGE:I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?

PATRICE: uh uh

GEORGE: What if it rains?

PATRICE: They're art. You hang them on the wall.

GEORGE:Oh, art!

PATRICE: It's my creative outlet. One of my passions.

GEORGE: Any money in it?

PATRICE: Who so belongs only to his age, references only popenjays and mumbo jumbos

GEORGE: Of course, right.

PATRICE: Thomas Carlisle, 1864.

GEORGE: Tommy C.



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.

KRAMER: I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited

JERRY: I don't blame you. I blame myself.

KRAMER: No, blame me.

JERRY: OK, I blame you.

KRAMER: Don't blame me.

JERRY: What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.

KRAMER: It was supposed to erupt.

JERRY: I find the whole thing very embarrassing.

KRAMER: You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.

JERRY: Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Hi,

JERRY: Hi

ELAINE: Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.

(Jerry smiles)

ELAINE: What's so funny

JERRY: Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.

ELAINE: Uh, it's a riot Alice.

KRAMER: When do you pit the sauce on?

ELAINE: Any other time.

KRAMER: I like to strain the sauce.

ELAINE: And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room

KRAMER: Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

ELAINE: What are you doing? What is all this?

JERRY: Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.

ELAINE: O, your being auditted? What for?

JERRY: Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.

ELAINE: When was this?

JERRY: Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.

ELAINE: I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.

JERRY: Volcano? Really?

ELAINE: Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...

JERRY: Something to drink?

ELAINE: What did you think, that would impress me?

JERRY: You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans

ELAINE: Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?

JERRY: Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.

ELAINE: Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.

JERRY: No, that's Krama.

ELAINE: So, waddya' going to do?

JERRY: It's all taken care of.

ELAINE: How is that?

KRAMER: (chuckles)

JERRY: An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.

ELAINE: Why is she doing this?

JERRY: I don't know. It must be love.



[Monks]

GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.

PATRICE: What did I do?

GEORGE: Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.

PATRICE: You hate my earrings don't you?

GEORGE: No, no,

PATRICE: And you didn't comment on the chop sticks.

GEORGE: I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.

PATRICE: You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something.

GEORGE: I have a fear of intimacy

PATRICE: Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?

GEORGE: Nothing. It's not YOU..

PATRICE: I want the truth.

GEORGE: The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?

PATRICE: Keep goin'.

GEORGE: I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.

PATRICE: No, I asked for the truth. Thank you for being so honest.

GEORGE: Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?

PATRICE: I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe?

GEORGE: Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: ... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands

ELAINE: I don't blame ya'

JERRY: Have you ever been through an audit?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah

GEORGE: George

JERRY: Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor

GEORGE: My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)

JERRY: And there's so much more to go.

GEORGE: Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth

JERRY: So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?

GEORGE: Oh, oh, your papers

JERRY: What happened you didn't give her the papers?

GEORGE: No. I did.

JERRY: SO?

GEORGE: ...I broke up with her.

(Kramer leaves)

JERRY: You what?

GEORGE: I broke up with her.

JERRY: I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?

GEORGE: It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.

JERRY: Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.

GEORGE: Oh, no. We left on good terms.

JERRY: How is that possible?

GEORGE: Because I uh, I told her the truth.

JERRY: Oh, my God.

GEORGE: It's OK.

JERRY: It's unheard of ...

GEORGE: She asked me to.

JERRY: So you lie! What did you tell her?

GEORGE: I told her that she was pretentious.

JERRY: Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want

ELAINE: How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?

GEORGE: Like what? What could they say?

ELAINE: There are plenty of things to say.

GEORGE: Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?

ELAINE: George, please.

GEORGE: Give me one.

ELAINE: You sure?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: What?

ELAINE: Forget it. You are very careful with money.

GEORGE: I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?

ELAINE: You asked me to.

GEORGE: You should have lied.

ELAINE: HUH, so should you.

JERRY: OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?

GEORGE:(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.

ELAINE: I know.

GEORGE: When I was working I spent baby.

JERRY: Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?

GEORGE: She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.

ELAINE: Pocketbook or a handbag?

JERRY: Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.

GEORGE: Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)

JERRY: What? What?

GEORGE: She never came back from lunch.

JERRY: This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.

GEORGE: (dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.

JERRY: Not good.

GEORGE: All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)

JERRY: Not good



[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a windshield.

JERRY: I can see that. What's it for?

KRAMER: I found it on the road.

JERRY: Yeah (to buzzer)

ELAINE: (from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.

JERRY: wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?

KRAMER: wow

(Elaine enters - she and Kramer avoid each other's stares)

ELAINE: hell-oo

KRAMER: hell-oo

JERRY: What's with you two?

ELAINE: You haven't told him?

JERRY: Tell me what?

ELAINE: Huh, go ahead, tell him.

KRAMER: I, I saw her naked.

ELAINE: He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.

KRAMER: Well, you know, ... it was an accident.

ELAINE: Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!

KRAMER: I thought it was a closet.

JERRY: Completely naked?

KRAMER: Completely naked.

ELAINE: Jerrryyy, How can I go on?

KRAMER: All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.

(Kramer begins disrobing)

ELAINE: No thanks!

KRAMER: No, I want you to see me naked.

ELAINE: No, no no.

KRAMER: No, I want to show you.

ELAINE: No! Jerry! Jerry!

JERRY: OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.

(Kramer sits down picks up windshield)

ELAINE: What is this?

KRAMER: Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.

ELAINE: Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.

JERRY: You'll sense it.

(George enters slowly)

JERRY: Well, what happened? Was she there?

GEORGE: No, no she wasn't.

JERRY: You didn't get my papers?

GEORGE: No, I didn't.

JERRY: Well, where is she?

GEORGE: A mental institution.



[Middle Monologue]

JERRY: Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: A mental institution?

KRAMER: You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.

GEORGE: It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.

ELAINE: Who told you this:

GEORGE: Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.

KRAMER: My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.

JERRY: You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!

GEORGE: She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.

JERRY: So what now?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Can we go out there?

GEORGE: Where?

JERRY: Woodhaven.

GEORGE: We could.



[Woodhaven]

GEORGE: I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.

JERRY: My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"

GEORGE: I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.

JERRY: That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.

GEORGE: Potato

JERRY: Tuberculosis

GEORGE: Blanket

JERRY: Leroy

GEORGE: Grass

JERRY: Tuberculosis

GEORGE: Oh, boy. Here she comes.



[Elaine's Apartment]

(African music is playing as Elaine enters, dirty pots and dishes are piled high in the kitchen)

ELAINE: Oh, my god.

(Kramer enters dancing with only a towel on.)

ELAINE: KRAMER!

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.

KRAMER: Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.

TINA: Kramer, are you coming back to bed?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.

TINA: Oh, hi Elaine. (returns Elaine's ear rings) What did you think of the coffee table?

ELAINE: It's invisible.

KRAMER: So, is everything cool? or what?

TINA: Yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional.

ELAINE: Well,

TINA: Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.

ELAINE: The Truth!, You want The Truth?



[Woodhaven]

PATRICE: Who are you?

GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend Jerry.

PATRICE: Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?

JERRY: Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.

PATRICE: George thinks I'm pretentious.

GEORGE: Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.

PATRICE: You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.

GEORGE: No, that's not it at all.

PATRICE: Don't LIE George.

GEORGE :I'M NOT A LIER!

GEORGE: Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)

JERRY: Just chatting. Friendly.

GEORGE: All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.

PATRICE: I know what you said. You can't change that.

GEORGE: What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.

JERRY: It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?

GEORGE: You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.

PATRICE: You mean that?

GEORGE: Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.

JERRY: He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.

PATRICE: Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.

JERRY: there are no copies.

PATRICE: So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?

JERRY: Who makes copies?



[Elaine's Apartment]

ELAINE: The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.

(Elaine exits)

KRAMER: Oh,

TINA: Kramer,

(dancing in the dark to the music)

TINA: Here Kramer?

KRAMER: No, lets go to the couch...

(sound of smashing glass)



[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: (on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.

JERRY: Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.

ELAINE: I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.

(Kramer enter - all bandaged up.)

KRAMER: Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?

ELAINE: Yeah, I suppose I am.

KRAMER: All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.

JERRY: You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.

GEORGE: Hey, I'm getting in on that.

ELAINE: You know you're chippin' in.

GEORGE: You're going that way anyway!



[Closing Monologue]

JERRY: I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"

JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."



[Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents]

HELEN: (looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again.

MORTY: (searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.

HELEN: Oh I think that's them!

MORTY: You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

(Jerry and Elaine enter)

ALL: Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc.

MORTY: Welcome to Florida!

ELAINE: Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)

JERRY: Hey, there's the old man! (hug)

MORTY: So, what took you so long?

JERRY: Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.

HELEN: I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.

JERRY: What's the difference?

HELEN: You could have used our car.

JERRY: I don't wanna use your car.

HELEN: What's wrong with our car?

JERRY: Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?

HELEN: We don't use it.

MORTY: What are you talking? We use it.

HELEN: If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.

JERRY: So what would you do? You'd hitch?

HELEN: How much is a rent-a-car?

JERRY: I don't know. 25 bucks a day.

HELEN: What? You're crazy.

MORTY: Plus the insurance.

JERRY: Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

MORTY: How could you not get the insurance?

HELEN: We'll pay for the car.

JERRY: You're not paying for it.

HELEN: Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)

JERRY: God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?

HELEN: You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?

JERRY: It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?

HELEN: Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.

JERRY: (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.

ELAINE: (looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?

JERRY: The lake isn't real.

HELEN: The lake is real.

MORTY: Are you kidding? They built the lake.

HELEN: But it's real. It's water.

(Jerry and Elaine take their luggages to the guest room)

HELEN: Where are you going with those?

JERRY: I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.

HELEN: Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.

ELAINE: I can't take your bedroom.

HELEN: I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

ELAINE: I can't kick you out of your bed.

HELEN: We don't even sleep.

JERRY: Ma.

HELEN: But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.

JERRY: (to Morty) What about you?

MORTY: Why should I be comfortable?

JERRY: (to Helen) What about him?

HELEN: Don't worry, he's comfortable.

MORTY: I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.

HELEN: Will you stop?

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)

HELEN: Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.

JERRY: Na, that's not such a good idea.

HELEN: Well I tought that...

JERRY: Not now. She's right inside.

HELEN: (quieter) What happened?

JERRY: I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.

HELEN: What does that mean?

JERRY: Well...

MORTY: (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?

JERRY: Shh! Nothing, nothing.

HELEN: Elaine...

MORTY: (still loud) What about her?

JERRY: (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.

MORTY: (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.

HELEN: He's an idealist.

MORTY: What the hell are you looking for?

JERRY: I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.

HELEN: He likes looking.

MORTY: So look.

HELEN: But how long can you look?

JERRY: I'm going for the record.

(Morty walks away with a face like he disagrees with Jerry)

HELEN: You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.

JERRY: Oh, come on.

HELEN: This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.

(knock on door: this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)

MORTY: Aha!

DORIS: So they arrived safely.

MORTY: (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?

JERRY: Nice to see you. This is Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi. Nice to meet you.

JACK: So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?

ELAINE: And scuba diving.

HELEN: Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?

JERRY: We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.

HELEN: What do you have to go scuba diving for?

JERRY: For fun.

HELEN: For fun?

MORTY: Jack have some spong cake.

JACK: No. thanks, no.

MORTY: Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.

JACK: So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?

JERRY: I don't think so.

JACK: No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).

MORTY: What did you have? You had the minute steak?

JACK: Yeah.

MORTY: Did you have a coke or what?

JACK: I did NOT have a coke.

MORTY: Somebody had a coke.

HELEN: Oh I had a coke.

DORIS: And I had the scampi.

JACK: So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.

MORTY: All right. Make it 20 bucks.

JACK: It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)

MORTY: 19.45$ ?

JACK: See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.

(Jerry notices Klompus's pen)

JERRY: What kind of pen is that?

JACK: This pen?

JERRY: Yeah.

JACK: This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.

JERRY: Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?

JACK: Oh it was a gift.

JERRY: Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.

JACK: Take the pen.

JERRY: Oh no.

JACK: Go ahead.

JERRY: I couldn't

JACK: Come on, take the pen!

JERRY: I can't take it.

JACK: Do me a personal favor!

JERRY: No, I'm not...

JACK: Take the pen!

JERRY: I cannot take it!

JACK: Take the pen!

JERRY: Are you sure?

JACK: Positive! Take the pen!

JERRY: O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!

HELEN: Jack, what are you doing?

JACK: Stop it!

DORIS: Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice meeting you.

ELAINE: Mmm, nice to meet you.

JERRY: Thanks again.

JACK: Come on!

DORIS: (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)

HELEN: (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?

JERRY: What he gave it to me.

HELEN: You didn't have to take it.

MORTY: Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.

JERRY: He offered it to me.

HELEN: Because you made such a big fuss about it.

JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?

HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)

JERRY: He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.

HELEN: He loves that pen.

MORTY: Oh come on!

HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.

JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.

HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet.

JERRY: Well, he was wrong.

HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)

JERRY: So you want me to return it?

HELEN: Yes.

MORTY: He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.

JERRY: Hey I don't even want the pen now!

MORTY: Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!

ELAINE: Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.

(scene ends)



[setting: condo's guest room]

(Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall asleep)

(knock on door)

ELAINE: Come in.

JERRY: Are you O.K. in here?

ELAINE: Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?

JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.

ELAINE: Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.

JERRY: Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.

ELAINE: I am never gonna fall asleep.

JERRY: Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.

ELAINE: How can they not put the air conditioning on?

JERRY: They're nuts with temperature.

ELAINE: This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.

JERRY: How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?

ELAINE: I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.

JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)

(scene ends)



[setting: condo, morning]

(Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)

MORTY: Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?

JERRY: Stay on Biscayne.

HELEN: You're going underwater?

JERRY: Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.

HELEN: What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?

JERRY: What's so special up here?

(Elaine open the guest room's door and she's in pain)

ELAINE: Oh!

(everybody get up and walk to her)

HELEN: What's the matter?

ELAINE: My back.

HELEN: What happened?

ELAINE: That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.

HELEN: (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.

JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.

ELAINE: I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.

JERRY: You can't go?

HELEN: So stay home.

ELAINE: You can go.

JERRY: Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.

HELEN: Don't go.

JERRY: You sure?

MORTY: Maybe you should see a doctor.

JERRY: We'll stay in a hotel tonight.

ELAINE: (whispering to Jerry) Yes!

HELEN: No, we'll stay in there.

JERRY: Why don't you get a new sofa?

MORTY: Nobody uses it.

JERRY: I'm buying you a new sofa.

HELEN: Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.

ELAINE: Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.

HELEN: You're hot?

ELAINE: I've lost 6 pounds.

HELEN: I don't even know how to work it.

MORTY: I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.

(Evelyn, a neighboor, enters)

EVELYN: Is everybody up?

JERRY: Hi. How are you?

EVELYN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.

ELAINE: (with pain) Hi Evelyn.

EVELYN: Jerry you got thin.

JERRY: Too thin?

HELEN: Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.

EVELYN: So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)

JERRY: (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?

EVELYN: The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.

HELEN: How did you know that?

EVELYN: Blanche told me.

HELEN: Blanche?

EVELYN: That's some good pen. It writes upside down.

ELAINE: The astronauts use them.

HELEN: What did Blanche say?

EVELYN: I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.

JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.

MORTY: He gave him the pen.

HELEN: Morty.

EVELYN: Why you don't like the pen?

JERRY: No, no, I...

EVELYN: Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.

HELEN: Is that what she said?

EVELYN: Who?

HELEN: Blanche.

EVELYN: What are you talking about?

(The phone rings, Helen answers.)

HELEN: Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)

ELAINE: Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!

MORTY: (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.

(the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.)

JERRY: All I said was "I like the pen".

(Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner)

MORTY: How the hell do you work this thing?

(scene ends)



[setting: still the condo, later]

(Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)

HELEN: Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

ELAINE: No no, I wanna go.

HELEN: But your back hurts.

MORTY: Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.

ELAINE: Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.

HELEN: No. I'm fine.

ELAINE: You're not too cold?

HELEN: No.

(Jerry enters with a black eye)

JERRY: Don't be alarmed.

MORTY: Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?

JERRY: I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.

HELEN: Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?

JERRY: (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?

ELAINE: Having a good time!

JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?

HELEN: What happened to your eyes?

JERRY: Well I started to go under...

HELEN: With the instructor?

JERRY: Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.

HELEN: I told you...

(Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar)

JACK: Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?

ELAINE: My back hurts.

JACK: Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.

MORTY: We got plenty of time.

JACK: (to Jerry) What happened to you?

JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.

HELEN: It's from scuba diving.

JACK: What's there to see underwater?

(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like: give him back the pen)

JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.

JACK: You what?

JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)

JACK: Well I mean...

JERRY: Take it.

JACK: All right! (he smiles and take it)

(Morty gets up and walks right to Jack)

MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

JACK: Whose pen?

MORTY: His pen.

JACK: This happens to be my pen.

MORTY: You didn't give it to him.

JACK: What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.

MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?

JACK: Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?

MORTY: You said you didn't want it!

JACK: Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!

MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?

(Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing)

JACK: Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!

MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!

JACK: Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!

MORTY: I don't want it!

JACK: I don't want it!

MORTY: You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!

JACK: Listen do you think I give a damn?

MORTY: Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.

JERRY: What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?

HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)

JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?

MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.

JERRY: Well. This should be a very interesting evening.

ELAINE: (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?

(scene ends)



[setting: reception room, evening]

(Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.)

PHOTOGRAPHER: Say astronaut.

(Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.)

ELAINE: Say what? (laughing) Say what?

JERRY: (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.

MORTY: Astronaut?

HELEN: Say it.

JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN: Astronaut!

ELAINE: (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!

(the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.)

MORTY: Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?

JERRY: Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)

JERRY: (to Leo) Uncle Leo.

LEO: Hello!

STELLA: Morty are you nervous?

MORTY: What nervous?

LEO: (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?

JERRY: I've got a black eye.

STELLA: (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.

JERRY: Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.

HELEN: (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!

JERRY: (to Stella) Her back hurts.

STELLA: Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.

LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.

JERRY: No, no.

LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.

ELAINE: (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!

LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.

MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!

LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.

(Jack and Morty exchange a look.)

STELLA: (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.

HELEN: (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.

(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells: "Hey Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)

JACK: (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.

MORTY: (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)

JACK: Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)

HELEN: (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.

JACK: His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.

MORTY: (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.

JACK: But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)

MORTY: (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)

JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!

JACK: He gave it to me!

MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!

JACK: I'm not sitting down!

(they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight)

JACK: Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)

HELEN: Jerry, do your act.

JERRY: (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.

HELEN: They're all gonna leave.

JERRY: (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)

MAN IN THE CROWD: Who are you?

JERRY: (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?

WOMAN IN THE CROWD: (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.

(Elaine is almost asleep at the table)

JERRY: Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?

MAN IN THE CROWD: I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!

HELEN: (to Jerry) Do the dog routine.

JERRY: All I said was I liked the pen!

ELAINE: (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!

(Everybody stops talking and put their hands on their ears)

[setting: condo, morning]

(Elaine is sitting on the couch and a chiro is examining her. Jerry's sitting next to her. Helen is standing beside them and Morty is still asleep in the guest room)

CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.

ELAINE: Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?

JERRY: There must be some mistake.

CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not.

ELAINE: (discouraged) Five days. Here.

HELEN: (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!

JERRY: (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...

ELAINE: Excuse me?

JERRY: Nothing.

(Evelyn enters)

EVELYN: Good morning.

JERRY: Hi Evelyn.

EVELYN: (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

HELEN: I don't think so.

EVELYN: Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.

HELEN: Well I'll ask him when he gets up.

EVELYN: Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.

(Morty gets up in a bad shape)

MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?

HELEN: I was very comfortable.

EVELYN: Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.

HELEN: It's in the constitution.

MORTY: (to the chiro) Who are you?

CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor.

MORTY: What are you kidding me?

ELAINE: (to Jerry) Five more days?

JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)

(scene ends)

[setting: night club, closing monologue]

JERRY: Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."

JERRY: So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!



[New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated) man.]

GAVIN: Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.

JERRY: Is he on the plane now?

GAVIN: Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?

JERRY: Uh, just my next door neighbor.

GAVIN: You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.

JERRY: Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?

(Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.)

JERRY: What's the matter?

GAVIN: Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.



[Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.]

ATTENDANT #1: Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital.

GAVIN: My dog. What about my dog?

ATTENDANT #1: Uh, you have a dog?

ATTENDANT #2: Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?

(Jerry stares out the window.)

GAVIN: Jerry?

JERRY: Huh? How you feeling?

GAVIN: Would you take care of Farfel?

JERRY: Farfel?

ATTENDANT #2: It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York?

JERRY: The dog? The dog??

GAVIN: I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

JERRY: But, you know, what if, you know?

GAVIN: Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.

JERRY: The dog?



[New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.]

JERRY: Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?

ELAINE: Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.

JERRY (to Farfel): STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.

ELAINE: If only.

JERRY: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.

ELAINE: Hey, when you walk him, do ya...

JERRY: Do I what?

ELAINE: Do you pick it up?

JERRY: Yes, I pick it up.

ELAINE: You pick it up?!?

JERRY: Well you have to.

ELAINE: Oh, boy would I love to see that.

JERRY: SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?

ELAINE: Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.

JERRY: No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.

ELAINE: No, milk.

JERRY: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.

ELAINE: What is a bender anyhow?

JERRY: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.

ELAINE: I can't believe he hasn't called.

JERRY: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.

JERRY: Why?

ELAINE: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.

KRAMER: I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.

JERRY: You're breaking up?

KRAMER: Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.

ELAINE: Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.

KRAMER: Woah, you didn't like her?

ELAINE: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.

JERRY: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.

KRAMER: How come you never said anything?

JERRY: Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.

KRAMER: I tell you.

JERRY: You. I'm talking about people.

ELAINE: Are we still going to the movies tonight?

JERRY: No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.

ELAINE: Just me and George?

JERRY: Sure.

ELAINE: But we need you.

JERRY: What do you need me for?

(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)

ELAINE: Because... Yeah?

GEORGE: Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)

(Elaine buzzes George into the building.)

ELAINE: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?

JERRY: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!

ELAINE: Just me and George alone?

(George enters.)

GEORGE: Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!

JERRY: I can't go.

GEORGE: Can't go, Why not?

JERRY: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

GEORGE: I thought Kramer was watching.

JERRY: He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.

GEORGE: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.

JERRY: No, I don't want that smell in the house.

GEORGE: You spritz a little Lysol on it.

JERRY: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.

GEORGE: So we're not going?

JERRY: Nah. You two go.

GEORGE: Oh. You still wanna go?

ELAINE: Do, do you?

GEORGE: If you want.

ELAINE: It,s, it's up to you.

JERRY: Go ahead.

ELAINE: Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?

GEORGE: Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?

JERRY: I want to but I can't.

ELAINE: Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: What about this--

JERRY: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.

ELAINE: I know, it's not that.

GEORGE: It's just we want you to go.

JERRY: Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!



[Comedy Club]

JERRY: On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?



[New scene. George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De Leon. They're obviously uncomfortable alone together.]

GEORGE: So how long did you live there?

ELAINE: About three years.

GEORGE: That's pretty long.

ELAINE: Hmm.

GEORGE: It's not that long, really.

ELAINE: Yeah.

(An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same time, then stop. Another silence.)

GEORGE: And then you came here.

ELAINE: Yeah. So I've been here about six years.

GEORGE (Counting on his fingers): Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.



[New scene. Jerry vs. Farfel, part II]

JERRY: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!



[New scene. Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend.]

KRAMER: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.



[New scene. Monk's, Elaine and George are as bored as before.]

GEORGE: I like herbal tea.

(Elaine yawns.)

GEORGE: Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.

ELAINE: Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

GEORGE: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

ELAINE: Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

GEORGE: You don't tell him?

ELAINE (laughing): No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"

GEORGE (laughing): You don't tell him?

ELAINE: No.

GEORGE: That is so funny!

ELAINE: I know!

GEORGE: Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!

(They both make the same convulsive gestures together and break out in more laughter.)



[New scene. Kramer has had a change of heart.]

KRAMER: Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!



[New scene. Jerry's at his apartment, on the phone, Farfel is barking.]

JERRY: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!



[New scene. Jerry and Elaine are cleaning Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.

JERRY: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.

ELAINE: The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.

JERRY (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay, see you in five minutes.

(Jerry hangs up the phone and begins singing and dancing.)

JERRY: Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?

ELAINE: Do you have to?

JERRY: What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.

ELAINE: You know, the guy might have just lost your number.

JERRY: I'm in the book and I have a machine.

ELAINE: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.

JERRY: Really? How late are they open?

(Kramer enters.)

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What is it?

KRAMER: I went back with Ellen.

JERRY and ELAINE: Ohhhhh, that's great.

ELAINE: Terrific.

JERRY: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.

ELAINE: Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.

KRAMER: Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?

JERRY: Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.

KRAMER: From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.

ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: I'm getting my pot.

(Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.)

ELAINE: Kramer, we like her.

JERRY: Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?

ELAINE: I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.

JERRY: I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,

JERRY: Well.

ELAINE: Well.

JERRY: everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?

GEORGE: Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)

(Farfel begins barking.)

JERRY: Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.

ELAINE: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.

JERRY: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.

ELAINE: Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.

JERRY: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?

ELAINE: We'll see it Sunday.

(George enters.)

GEORGE: Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?

ELAINE: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.

GEORGE: What does this mean?

JERRY: Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.

GEORGE: What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.

JERRY: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?

JERRY: I don't know, regular human time?

GEORGE: Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?

JERRY: Why shouldn't I go here?

ELAINE: Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: And isn't it more fun using the urinal?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!

GEORGE: Hey, go.

ELAINE: Who's stopping you?

GEORGE: What, are you doing me a favor?

ELAINE: Like we care if you go to the bathroom.

(Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.)

GEORGE: How's it going?

ELAINE: Good. Good. You?

GEORGE: Things are good.

(After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.)

ELAINE: Boy, he takes such a long time.

GEORGE: I know.

ELAINE: You know what he does in there? He gargles.

GEORGE: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?

ELAINE: Yeah, he does it like six times a day.

GEORGE: How come we never hear him?

ELAINE: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.

(Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.)

GEORGE: Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!

ELAINE: We talked about that already.

GEORGE: Oh.



[New scene. Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater.]

GEORGE: I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.

JERRY: So what are calling me six times a day?

GEORGE: All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.

JERRY: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.

GEORGE: Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.

JERRY: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?

GEORGE: Nothing except Prognosis Negative.

JERRY: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.



[New scene. Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.]

ELAINE: Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!

(The phone rings, Farfel begins barking.)

ELAINE: Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.



[Cut back to Jerry and George.]

GEORGE: I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.

JERRY: I don't know what to do.

GEORGE: What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.

JERRY: I know, I know.

GEORGE: So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.

JERRY: It is kind of silly.

GEORGE: Of course it is.

JERRY: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.

GEORGE: Exactly.

JERRY: It's not like she's *in* the movie.

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.

GEORGE: And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.

JERRY: How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.

GEORGE: Good.

JERRY: Saving movies.

GEORGE: Ridiculous!

JERRY: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.

GEORGE: Oh, you're dead.



[New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. Farfel is barking as loud as ever.]

GAVIN: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!

JERRY: You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.

GAVIN: Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians.

KRAMER: Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!

GAVIN: He won't hurt you, he's just playing.

KRAMER: Hey you keep that mutt away from me.

GAVIN: Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.

ELLEN: Kramer, are you coming?

JERRY: Oh, hi Ellen.

ELLEN: Get in here.

(Kramer sulks off.)

JERRY: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...

GAVIN: Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.

JERRY: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.

(Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's apartment.)



[New scene. Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: We made plans.

JERRY: Why don't we just rent a movie?

ELAINE: I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.

JERRY: No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...

ELAINE: Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

JERRY: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.

ELAINE: Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.

JERRY: You and George got together?

ELAINE: Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.

(Kramer enters.)

JERRY: Hello.

KRAMER: Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

JERRY: What's up?

KRAMER: Well, ah you were right.

JERRY: About what?

KRAMER: Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.

JERRY and ELAINE, together: Awwwwww.

JERRY: Too bad.

ELAINE: I thought she was the one.

KRAMER: I'll bring back the pot.

ELAINE: Okay, c'mon it's movie time.

KRAMER: Hey, what are you gonna see?

JERRY: Prognosis Negative.

KRAMER: Hey, that's supposed to be great.

JERRY: It's not.

KRAMER: How do you know?

JERRY: I have an instinct for these things.



[Closing monologue; Comedy Club]

JERRY: I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?

JERRY: Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'



[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?

KRAMER: enters

JERRY: Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.

KRAMER: What's the problem?

JERRY: This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.

KRAMER: Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000

JERRY: It doesn't work like that.

KRAMER: If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000

JERRY: It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...

FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)

JERRY: That orange dress is burned in my memory

KRAMER: Oh, memory burn.

JERRY: I wonder what ever happened to her.

KRAMER: How did they ever find you?

JERRY: Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.

(buzzer)

JERRY: It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library

KRAMER: You know I never got a library card.

JERRY: (to speaker) Coming down.

KRAMER: It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,

JERRY: I gotta go to the library. You want to go?

KRAMER: Yeah,



[LIBRARY]

KRAMER: The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
JERRY: Where's George

READER: Shhh.

KRAMER: Tryin' to save a quarter.

JERRY: I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.

TURNING TO LIBRARY COUNTER

JERRY: This woman's completely ignoring me.

KRAMER: Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.

JERRY: Eventually a little shot of penicillin

LIBRARIAN: Yes?

JERRY: Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.

LIBRARIAN: Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.

KRAMER: Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?

LIBRARIAN: It's true.

KRAMER: That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.

LIBRARIAN: Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.

JERRY: Can I speak with this Bookman?

LIBRARIAN: Just a second.

(GEORGE ENTERS, FRANTICALLY, TUGS AT JERRY'S JACKET)

GEORGE: Jerry, Jerry

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I think I saw him. I think it's him.

JERRY: Who?

GEORGE: Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: yeah

GEORGE: I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.

READER: Shhh.

JERRY: (whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?

GEORGE: He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.

JERRY: George got him fired. He squealed on him.

KRAMER: Ooh tattle tale

GEORGE: (yells) I didn't tattle

READER: Shh Shh

KRAMER: What did this guy do? What happened?

GEORGE: There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.

KRAMER: Oh come on, You can tell me.

GEORGE: Some other time.

KRAMER: What tonight?

(LIBRARIAN WALKS BY)

KRAMER: Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.

JERRY: Oh, he sang like a canary.

LIBRARIAN: Mr. Bookman's not here.

JERRY: Not here? Why was I told to come down here?

LIBRARIAN: He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

KRAMER: He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?

JERRY: Well what am I supposed to do now?

LIBRARIAN: I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.

JERRY: All right Thanks. Come on lets go

GEORGE: Let's see if it's Hayman?

KRAMER: Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?



[PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES]

ELAINE: Where's Karen?

SECRETARY: She went to pick up lunch.

ELAINE: Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.

SECRETARY: She must have forgot.

ELAINE: How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?

Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.

Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.

SECRETARY: I don't know anything.

ELAINE: Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."

(LIPPMAN ENTERS)

ELAINE: Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.

LIPPMAN: Elaine,

ELAINE: Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?

LIPPMAN: Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.

ELAINE: Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.



[AT MONKS]

ELAINE: I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.

JERRY: So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!

ELAINE: What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!

GEORGE: I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?

ELAINE: What did he do?

GEORGE: He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.

JERRY: I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...

GEORGE: OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.

JERRY: I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.

GEORGE: Little baked beans

JERRY: Echh

ELAINE: Come on tell me what happened.

GEORGE: Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!



[FLASHBACK TO HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM]

GEORGE: ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...

HEYMAN: Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja

GEORGE: Yes, Mr. Hayman

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.

GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.

HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...

HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

(GEORGE gets a wedgie)

 


[BACK TO MONK'S]

GEORGE: He gave me a wedgie.

JERRY: He got fired the next day.

ELAINE: Why do they call it a wedgie?

GEORGE: Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..

JERRY: They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.

ELAINE: Boys are sick.

JERRY: Well what do girls do ?

ELAINE: We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.

(KRAMER ENTERS)

GEORGE: I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.

KRAMER: Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.



[MIDDLE MONOLOGUE]

JERRY: What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?



[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?

BOOKMAN: You got any coffee?

JERRY: Coffee?

BOOKMAN: Yeah. Coffee.

JERRY: No, I don't drink coffee.

BOOKMAN: Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?

JERRY: No, I don't have--

BOOKMAN: You don't have any instant coffee?

JERRY: Well, I don't normally--

BOOKMAN: Who doesn't have instant coffee?

JERRY: I don't.

BOOKMAN: You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.

JERRY: Really? I'll have to remember that.

BOOKMAN: You took this book out in 1971.

JERRY: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

BOOKMAN: Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.

JERRY: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.

BOOKMAN: You're a comedian, you make people laugh.

JERRY: I try.

BOOKMAN: You think this is all a big joke, don't you?

JERRY: No, I don't.

BOOKMAN: I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?

JERRY: Certainly not.

BOOKMAN: Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!

(Marion sneaks into Kramer's apartment behind Bookman's back as he opens Jerry's door to leave)



[KRAMER'S APARTMENT]

KRAMER: What's wrong?

MARION: It's Bookman the library cop.

KRAMER: So I, I didn't do anything wrong.

MARION: I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.

KRAMER: Why don't ya' leave?

MARION: I can't.

(JERRY'S DOORWAY)

JERRY: No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...

 

[IN MONKS WITH SHERRY]

SHERRY: Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.

JERRY: So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?

SHERRY: I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.

JERRY: Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?

SHERRY: Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?

JERRY: No Black Jack?

SHERRY: Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,

JERRY: Tropic of Cancer.

SHERRY: No, Tropic of Capricorn

JERRY: Tropic of Capricorn?

SHERRY: Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... "As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse ."

JERRY: Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.

We read from TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. I was all set to return TROPIC OF CANCER. And then ...



[FLASHBACK TO LOCKER ROOM]

JERRY: George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it

JERRY: Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.



[BACK TO MONKS]

SHERRY: Where ya' going?

JERRY: It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!



[LIBRARY]

KRAMER: Read another poem.

MARION: Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.

KRAMER: Wow, that is great. You should be published.

KRAMER: You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.

MARIAN: Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO!

KRAMER: HELLO!

MARIAN: HELLO!

KRAMER: HELLO!

MARIAN: HELLO!

BOOKMAN (emerging): Hello!

MARIAN (turning, surprised): Mr. Bookman.

BOOKMAN: I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?

 

[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

(Jerry in bedroom)

ELAINE: Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good

JERRY: Maybe you're getting' a raise.

(buzzer)

ELAINE: Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: It's George

ELAINE: George is on his way up.

JERRY: Wait 'til I tell him about the book.

KRAMER: (reading) sobs

ELAINE: Are you OK? What? What?

KRAMER: It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)

ELAINE: Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT

(Jerry enters).

JERRY: I'm right here.

ELAINE: Remember that Columbus book?

JERRY: Columbus, Euro trash.

(George enters)

GEORGE: Well, it's definetly him.

ELAINE: Him? Him who?

GEORGE: Him who? Hayman him.

ELAINE: Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?

GEORGE: Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus

JERRY: That was double overtime.

GEORGE: So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.

ELAINE: At least it wasn't atomic.

GEORGE: It was.

JERRY: So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER

GEORGE: How should I know?

JERRY: Because I gave it to you.

GEORGE: Me?

JERRY: Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.

GEORGE: The locker room!



[THE LOCKER ROOM]

JERRY: Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.

JERRY: All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.

HEYMAN: Can't Stand Ya'.

GEORGE: Yes Mr. Hayman.

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.

GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.

HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...

HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

(George gets a wedgie and TROPIC OF CANCER falls on floor)

GEORGE: (shouting) No No No!



[LIBRARY]

( Jerry writes out a check for the never-returned TROPIC OF CANCER and hands it to Bookman)

JERRY: Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.

BOOKMAN: Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?

JERRY: What is your problem?

BOOKMAN: What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle.

JERRY: (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?

ELAINE: Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.

JERRY: Oh, beautiful did he like them?

ELAINE: No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!

JERRY: (to George) Was he out there?

GEORGE: Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.

JERRY: I guess we'll never know.



[SOME BACK ALLEY]

HEYMAN: Can't stand ya, (laughing) Can't stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground)



[CLOSING MONOLOGUE]

JERRY: Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.

[ACT ONE SCENE A INT. ESCALATOR - GOING DOWN TO A GARAGE. IN SINGLE FILE: GEORGE, JERRY AND ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.]

GEORGE: One left...what a joke.

KRAMER: You can have this one.

GEORGE: No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.

ELAINE: Hey, I didn't get one either.

JERRY: Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?

ELAINE: This is what people do.

JERRY: No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.

(THEY GET OFF THE ESCALATOR AND HEAD FOR THE CAR.)



[ACT ONE SCENE B INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE AND KRAMER.]

GEORGE: You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.

ELAINE: So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?

GEORGE: Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.

JERRY: Big accomplishment.

GEORGE: Fish. What do they do?

ELAINE: What do you do?

KRAMER: It's this way.

GEORGE: What time is it?

JERRY: Five o'clock.

GEORGE: Always late. Always late.

JERRY: You're not late.

GEORGE: I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.

ELAINE: Who?

GEORGE: My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?

JERRY: Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.

ELAINE: Isn't it going the other way?

JERRY: There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.

ELAINE: But it's Saturday.

JERRY: You got the picnic and burger traffic.

GEORGE: I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

(KRAMER STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND.)

ELAINE: What's the matter?

(HE MUMBLES SOMETHING AND CONTINUES WALKING.)

JERRY: I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?

(KRAMER STUMBLES WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER.)

JERRY: (CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?

KRAMER: No, no, I got it.

(AND HE STUMBLES AGAIN. JERRY SPOTS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.)

JERRY: (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?

GEORGE: Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.

KRAMER: If you like her, go talk to her.

GEORGE: Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.

KRAMER: She's fat.

ELAINE: Oh she's fat?

KRAMER STOPS AGAIN, CONFUSED.

ELAINE: What? JERRY Where's the car?

KRAMER: I thought it was here.

GEORGE: You don't know where we parked?

(KRAMER LOOKS AROUND, THEN RESUMES WALKING. THEY FOLLOW.)

GEORGE: Oh, this is great.

KRAMER: Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.

JERRY: I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.

ELAINE: I didn't pay attention.

GEORGE: This is just what I need.

ELAINE: I'm sure it's right around here.

KRAMER: It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.

GEORGE: There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.

JERRY: It's over there. I know where it is.

(NOW JERRY TAKES THE LEAD AND THE OTHERS FOLLOW.)

ELAINE: It's black, right?

KRAMER: Dark blue.

GEORGE: (MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?

JERRY: There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.

THEY STOP...

JERRY: (CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...

KRAMER: Didn't we come in over there?

JERRY: I thought it was over there.

(FROM THERE P.O.V. THE CAMERA DOES A THREE SIXTY AND WE GET A SENSE OF HOW ENORMOUS THIS PLACE IS, THEN)

ELAINE: How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?

KRAMER: About two hours.

ELAINE: (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.

GEORGE: It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF:

GEORGE & ELAINE WITH KRAMER & JERRY BEHIND THEM.

JERRY: I really have to go to the bathroom.

KRAMER: Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J

ERRY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.

KRAMER: (CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.

JERRY: I'll wait.

KRAMER: You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?

JERRY: Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.

(ANGLE ON ELAINE AND GEORGE...)

ELAINE: (RE: CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.

(A CAR SCREECHES AROUND A CURVE, ELAINE IS UNNERVED.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.

GEORGE: ...Six wrong?

ELAINE: Those school zones are a killer.

JERRY: (TO KRAMER, RE:BOX) Will you let me help you with that?

KRAMER: I'm gonna put it down behind that car.

HE DOES SO.

JERRY: You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?

KRAMER: (TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.

GEORGE: Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.

ELAINE: (LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.

KRAMER: Look at this place. It's huge...

GEORGE: I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.

JERRY: Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."

GEORGE: Where the hell is this car, Kramer?

KRAMER: It's got to be here.

ELAINE: Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.

JERRY: Maybe it's not on this level.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?

ELAINE: It felt like a couple of levels.

JERRY: You should always carry a pad and pen.

GEORGE: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.

KRAMER: I have a pen.

THEY REACT...

JERRY: Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."

MOTHER: (O.C.) Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?

ELAINE: Look at that woman.

SHE'S HITTING HER BOY ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

MOTHER: I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.

GEORGE: (TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?

MOTHER: (TO GEORGE) Why don't you mind your own business?

GEORGE: I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.

KID: (TO GEORGE) You're ugly.

GEORGE: ...What?

KID: You're ugly.

GEORGE: You are!

KID: You are!

(THE KID GETS IN THE CAR. GEORGE IS STUNNED.)

GEORGE: I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.

KRAMER: (RE: CAR) I found it!

ELAINE: He's got it.

KRAMER: Oh...no.

JERRY: All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?

ELAINE: Jerry, look at my fish.

(JERRY HOLDS UP THE BAG AND HITS IT WITH HIS FINGER.)

JERRY: His eyes look a little cloudy.

GEORGE: Oh are they gonna be furious.

JERRY: Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!

KRAMER: It was easy the last time.

ELAINE: My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.

JERRY: No one's going to do that.

(ELAINE SPOTS A FORTY-ISH, STYLISH COUPLE WALKING TO THEIR CAR.)

ELAINE: Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.

MAN #1: (HOLDING HIS HANDS UP) ...Sorry.

ELAINE: Five minutes.

MAN #1: Can't do it.

ELAINE: We're not wilding.

THEY LEAVE.

(SHE APPROACHES TWO GIRLS - EARLY TWENTIES, MALL KIDS.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...

(THEY START LAUGHING.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?

(THEY IGNORE HER AND KEEP LAUGHING. CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.)

JERRY: Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?

KRAMER: Right here at the mall.

(BACK TO ELAINE, SEEKING OUT A MAN WITH A BEARD.)

ELAINE: Excuse me...

(HE IGNORES HER AND KEEPS WALKING.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.

(CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.)

JERRY: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.

KRAMER: You drank a whole bottle of water.

JERRY: I know.

KRAMER: So why don't you just go?

JERRY: No I can't.

KRAMER: Don't you get tired of following rules?

JERRY: You think I'm too cautious?

KRAMER: Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.

JERRY: Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.

KRAMER: Buddy Hackett?

JERRY: He's a comedian.

KRAMER: I know.

JERRY: All right. All right.

KRAMER: (pointing) You can go over here.

JERRY: I can manage.

KRAMER: (turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)

KRAMER: It'll take you ten seconds.

HE NUDGES JERRY.

JERRY: Okay, okay. I'll be right back.

(WE STAY WITH JERRY AS HE WALKS TO THE BACK OF A CAR, LOOKS AROUND LIKE SUPERMAN, THEN LETS FLY. HE FINISHES, ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS AND SEES A SECURITY GUARD STARING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED.)

SECURITY GUARD: Okay, let's go. Come with me.

JERRY: But...

SECURITY GUARD: Come on.

JERRY: (STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer

(END OF ACT ONE)



[ACT TWO SCENE C INT. SECURITY GUARD'S OFFICE - A SMALL ROOM WITH A DESK AND A CHAIR. JERRY PLEADS FOR HIS RELEASE.]

JERRY: I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.

SECURITY GUARD: Well you're still not allowed.

JERRY: Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?

SECURITY GUARD: That's up to you.

JERRY: So you don't care if I die.

SECURITY GUARD: What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.

JERRY: It was life and death.

SECURITY GUARD: Uh huh.

JERRY: Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.

SECURITY GUARD: I don't know.

JERRY: Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.

JERRY: (C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.

SECURITY GUARD: You can tell the police all about it.



[ACT TWO SCENE D INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE, KRAMER, AND ELAINE.]

KRAMER: (CALLING OUT) Jerry!

ELAINE: Jerry!

GEORGE: Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.

ELAINE: Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.

GEORGE: Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.

GEORGE: If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.

ELAINE: No, no, I'll be back.

(SHE LEAVES.)

GEORGE: Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.

KRAMER: Does that bother you?

GEORGE: Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?

KRAMER: Not at all.

GEORGE: See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?

KRAMER: I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?



[ACT TWO SCENE E INT. SECURITY OFFICE - JERRY AND THE SECURITY GUARD.]

JERRY: First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.

SECURITY GUARD: I know what you did.

JERRY: Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.

JERRY: (CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.

SECURITY GUARD: Yeah I'm sure.

JERRY: You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.



[ACT TWO SCENE F INT. PARKING GARAGE - ELAINE, LOOKING FOR JERRY. SHE'S TALKING TO AN OLDER BLACK MAN ABOUT TO GET IN HIS CAR.]

ELAINE: And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.

MAN #1: I can't do it.

ELAINE: But why? Why can't you do it?

MAN #1: I can't.

ELAINE: No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.

MAN #1: That's right.

ELAINE: But why? Why don't you want to?

MAN #1: I don't know.

ELAINE: But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?

MAN #:1 No, I wouldn't.



[ACT TWO SCENE G INT. SECURITY SHACK]

JERRY: (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.

JERRY: (CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.



[ACT TWO SCENE H INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE AND KRAMER, STILL LOOKING FOR THE CAR.]

KRAMER: The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.

GEORGE: (NOT INTERESTED) Really.

KRAMER: What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?

GEORGE: Who's Killer Kowalski?

KRAMER: He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.

GEORGE: I've gotta go to the bathroom.

KRAMER: So go. GEORGE Here?

KRAMER: (SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.

(GEORGE WALKS OUT OF THE FRAME AS KRAMER CONTINUES TO SCAN THE GARAGE. CUT TO GEORGE FINISHING UP. HE ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS, STARTLED. CUT TO THE SAME SECURITY GUARD, ARMS FOLDED, STARING AT HIM.)



[ACT TWO SCENE J INT. SECURITY OFFICE - GEORGE BEING LED IN BY THE SECURITY GUARD.]

GEORGE: Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...

SECURITY GUARD: Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?

JERRY: (TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?

GEORGE: (TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?



[ACT TWO SCENE K INT. PARKING GARAGE - KRAMER, WANDERING AIMLESSLY.]

KRAMER: George! George!


[ACT TWO SCENE L INT. PARKING GARAGE]

ELAINE: Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)



[ACT TWO SCENE M INT. PARKING GARAGE - JERRY AND GEORGE ARE BACK IN THE GARAGE EACH HOLDING THEIR SUMMONS.]

JERRY: Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.

JERRY: Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.

ELAINE: (O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!

ELAINE: (O.C.) Jerry! Over here...

(NOW THEY SPOT HER.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) Where have you been?

JERRY: I was arrested for urinating.

GEORGE: (PROUDLY) Me too.

ELAINE: You what?

JERRY: I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.

ELAINE: Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...

JERRY: No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)

ELAINE: (DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.

MAN #2: Can't do it.

ELAINE: I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?

MAN #3: Sorry. (THEY KEEP WALKING.)

ELAINE: That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.

(THEY LOOK BACK AT HER.)

ELAINE: (CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?

GEORGE: Elaine, shut-up.

JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?

GEORGE: I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?

ELAINE: I thought he was with you.

GEORGE: See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...

(HE LOOKS AT JERRY'S WATCH AND THROWS HIS HANDS UP.)

GEORGE: (CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.

ELAINE: Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?

GEORGE: We came in over there!

ELAINE: We didn't come in over there!

JERRY: Where's Kramer?

(JERRY SEES THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN THEY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, AMY.)

JERRY: Hey George, there she is again. ...

GEORGE: So what do you want me to do?

JERRY: Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.

GEORGE: That is an opening.

(GEORGE TENTATIVELY APPROACHES HER...)

GEORGE: (CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...

AMY: Oh sure, I'll drive you around.

GEORGE: You will?

AMY: Sure.

(GEORGE WAVES FOR JERRY AND ELAINE.)

GEORGE: Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.

AMY: I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Filthy pigs.

(THEY ALL GET IN THE CAR.)

GEORGE: It's a blue Honda...

AMY: This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.

ELAINE: Hi, I'm Elaine.

JERRY: Jerry.

AMY: Hello.

ELAINE: It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.

AMY: I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy.

GEORGE: Hi Amy, I'm George.

(GEORGE TURNS TO THE BACK SEAT AND GIVES AND GIVE A, "HOW BOUT THIS?" LOOK.)



[ACT TWO SCENE N INT. PARKING GARAGE - MINUTES LATER LONG SHOT OF CAR - THE BRAKES SQUEAL AND THE CAR COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP, THEN GEORGE, ELAINE, AND JERRY GET OUT.]

GEORGE: (TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...

(SHE PULLS OUT, LEAVING RUBBER, THEN)

GEORGE: (CONT'D) ...with that group.

ELAINE: (SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?

JERRY: Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.

ELAINE: I'll say.

(THEY TURN TO GEORGE, WHO'S GAPING AT SOMETHING.)

ELAINE: What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!

JERRY: The car!

GEORGE: The car!

ELAINE: We found it. I can't believe it!

THEY WALK TO IT...SUDDENLY GEORGE STOPS.

GEORGE: Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!

JERRY: Kramer!

(THEY ALL SLUMP AGAINST THE CAR. ELAINE HOLDS UP HER FISH)



[ACT TWO SCENE P INT. PARKING GARAGE - ONE HOUR LATER SAME SHOT - BUT NO FISH. IN THE DISTANCE WE CAN MAKE OUT KRAMER STRUGGLING WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER. JERRY TAPS ELAINE WITH HIS ELBOW. ELAINE TAPS GEORGE. WE STAY ON KRAMER AS HE GETS CLOSER.]

JERRY: Kramer.

KRAMER: Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah, over here.

KRAMER: Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?

GEORGE: Purple 23.

KRAMER: Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.

GEORGE: Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.

(THEY GET IN THE CAR.)

KRAMER: What time is it?

GEORGE: Seven forty-five.

KRAMER: Well at least there's no traffic.

GEORGE: Right.

KRAMER: What time does that play start?

GEORGE: Eight o'clock.

KRAMER: That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...

(JERRY INDICATES HE SHOULDN'T PURSUE THAT.)

KRAMER: (CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?

SILENCE. HE STARTS UP THE CAR AND AS THEY HEAD OUT... FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO

You know there's like always one, location in your neighborhood, one store location that's constantly, changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, then it's a yogurt shop, then it's a pet supply. It's like constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in the mother ship from Close Encounters, the bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out, in a daze going ?I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you??
 

[George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says Grand opening.]

GEORGE: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't nice.

JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.

GEORGE: Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?

JERRY: What's that smell? What are you wearing?

GEORGE: What, a 'little' cologne.

JERRY: Manly.

GEORGE: Monica wants me to wear it.

JERRY: So why didn't you say no?

GEORGE: I'm too nice.

JERRY: Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.

GEORGE: She wants me to take an IQ test.

JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.

GEORGE: No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.

JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.

GEORGE: You know, I can't talk to you anymore.

JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.

GEORGE: Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.

JERRY: Who thinks you're smart?

GEORGE: I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.

JERRY: What thing?

GEORGE: You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!

JERRY: Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.

GEORGE: I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.

JERRY: What'd ya get?

GEORGE: What did I get or what do I say I got?

JERRY: What do you say?

GEORGE: I say fourteen o nine (1409).

JERRY: 1409, that's a good score.

GEORGE: Psst, You're telling me.

JERRY: What did you really get?

GEORGE: You are my friend.

JERRY: Of course.

GEORGE: I tell you everything, right?

JERRY: I hope so.

GEORGE: Well, this I take to the grave.
 
 

[Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars and Elaine is reading a newspaper.]

JERRY: He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.

ELAINE: Why do you keep watching?

JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second.

ELAINE: And then you flush.

JERRY: Well, it's a spider.

ELAINE: You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.

(Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.)

ELAINE: Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.

JERRY: Bazooka Joe.

(Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at and motions with his arm to Elaine who is closer to the door.)

JERRY: The buzzer.

ELAINE: It's your house.

JERRY: My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)

INTERCOM: It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

ELAINE: Casus belli.

JERRY: What's that?

ELAINE: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.

JERRY: Come on, Go in, go in!  [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]

ELAINE: Have you gone in there?

JERRY: No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.

(George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.)

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.

(Elaine sniffs around George.)

GEORGE: I'm wearing some cologne, all right?

ELAINE: Sure, fine.

JERRY: Casus belli.

ELAINE: Casus belli.

GEORGE: What's that?

ELAINE: Since when do you wear cologne?

GEORGE: Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.

JERRY: Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?

GEORGE: I didn't take it, yet.

(Elaine opens up the newspaper and starts leafing through it, reading some articles while still maintaining her part of the conversation)

ELAINE: What IQ test?

GEORGE: What's casus belli.

JERRY: Oh, it's nothing...

GEORGE: Is it about me?

JERRY: Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?

ELAINE: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?

JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like fun.

GEORGE: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.

ELAINE: You'll do well, you're smart.

JERRY: No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.

ELAINE: Wha'd you get on your SAT's?

GEORGE: It varies.

JERRY: You know, I don't even know my IQ.

ELAINE: huh, Mine's 145.

GEORGE: 145!

JERRY: Get out of here!

ELAINE: You get out of here!

JERRY: You get out of here!

ELAINE: Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)

GEORGE: Shst, You should take the test for me.

ELAINE: Huh.

JERRY: Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.

GEORGE: Haha (laughs)

JERRY: Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.  (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?

(Jerry tosses something to Elaine and she catches it)

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.

ELAINE: Are you serious?

GEORGE: Why not?

ELAINE: Where would I take the test?

GEORGE: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.

ELAINE: No, that'd be too noisy.

JERRY: Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.

ELAINE: Hey, what do you think?

JERRY: Hey, I love a good caper.

ELAINE: Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.

GEORGE: You'll do it?

ELAINE: What the hey.

GEORGE: Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu anxiously looking out the window. Jerry comes in.]

Babu Bhatt: Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

JERRY: Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.

BABU: Oh, ah how did you hear about us?

JERRY: Eh, people, people are talking.

BABU: Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both.

JERRY: Ah, non-smoking would be great.

BABU: Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot folded face cloth for your pleasure.

JERRY: Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]

BABU: Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.

JERRY: Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?

BABU: Oh, the turkey.

JERRY: Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.

BABU: You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...

JERRY: (thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
 
 

[George is taking a test in Monica's bedroom.]

GEORGE: You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.

MONICA: But why?

GEORGE: I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.

MONICA: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.

GEORGE: Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.

MONICA: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.

GEORGE: Well, I think you're wrong about that.  [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.

MONICA: Good luck.

GEORGE: Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)

(Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is waiting outside.)

ELAINE: What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.

GEORGE: I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.

ELAINE: All right, what time do you want me back here.

GEORGE: Ah, ah, twenty to three.

ELAINE: Ok.

GEORGE: Thanks again.

ELAINE: All right.

GEORGE: A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)

(George gives Elaine the thumbs up, closes the window and then gives her the OK sign.)
 
 

[Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for Jerry.]

JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.

BABU: It is in deed my pleasure.

JERRY: Oh, please...

(Elaine comes in carrying the envelope with the IQ test and a pencil in her mouth.)

BABU: Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. (runs to get a menu.) Our specials today...

ELAINE: Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)

BABU: Tea and toast.

JERRY: Eat something! Babu...

ELAINE: Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.

BABU: Oh, oh very good choice. Very good.

(Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.)

JERRY: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.

ELAINE: I know.

(Kramer comes in.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Oh boy. Woop...

(Kramer sitting down at the table next to Elaine - he sits a bit too hard and shakes the table -- silverware and plates rattle ... mustard bottle teetering - thus startling Elaine, who stops the test for a moment, but gets right back to it.)

KRAMER: Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...  (pats her on the shoulder twice.)

ELAINE: Hey.

KRAMER: This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.

JERRY: So?

KRAMER: Well, I'm not giving it back.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?

(Kramer takes some nachos and spills some of them on the IQ test.)

KRAMER: Oh, gees...

ELAINE: Ok,

KRAMER: You're all right

ELAINE: Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)

KRAMER: (eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?

JERRY: Statute.

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.

KRAMER: No, it's statue.

JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.

KRAMER: Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?

ELAINE: Statute.

KRAMER: Oh, I really think you're wrong.

ELAINE: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.

KRAMER: What test?

ELAINE: An IQ test.

KRAMER: Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?

ELAINE: It's for George.

KRAMER: George?

ELAINE: Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?

KRAMER: Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?

ELAINE: Would you please?!

KRAMER: What, is it for a job or something?

ELAINE: Later!

KRAMER: You're positive it's statute?

ELAINE: Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)

BABU: Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face towel for your... (gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams, Elaine screams and Kramer falls from his chair.  He gets up and is dazed)
 
 

[Monica's. George is reading a New Yorker on the bed and Monica is trying to get in. The door is locked.]

MONICA: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

MONICA: The door is locked.

GEORGE: Oh, it's locked?

MONICA: I need to get something.

GEORGE: Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)

MONICA: George!

GEORGE: Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu is cleaning and singing -- Jerry is seemingly enjoying Babu's singing as Elaine gets distracted from the IQ test.]

BABU: Nananeena, Ladadeeda, laadadeeda, saadina.... Laadadeeda sa saadina (singing too loud)

ELAINE: Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?

BABU: Set. ok

ELAINE: Set.

BABU: I'll get it ...

(Babu comes to collect dishes from Elaine's table and knocks down a cup of coffee.)

ELAINE: Oh my God! It's all over the test!

BABU: Oh, I did sc-I'm terribly sorry.

JERRY: Oh my God.

ELAINE: Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.

BABU: Please, forgive me, please...

JERRY: Go ahead, I'll take care of it.

ELAINE: Uhh.

BABU: (opens the door for Elaine) Please, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!

(Babu sits down at the table and Jerry sits down across from him)

JERRY: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.

BABU: You're a very kind man.

JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani, right?

BABU: Yes, Pakistani, yes.

JERRY: Babu, may I say something?

BABU: Of course, you're very smart man, I listen.

JERRY: I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.

BABU: But there are no Pakistani people here.

JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.

BABU: Yes, you see everything, don't you?

JERRY: Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.

BABU: I close down today and when I open again it'll be all Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you so much, you're very special person, very special.

(Babu leaves)

JERRY (thinking) I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?
 
 

[Elaine is giving the test back to George.]

ELAINE: It was an accident.

GEORGE: What did you go on a picnic?

ELAINE: Babu Bhatt did it.

GEORGE: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?

MONICA: Time's up George.

GEORGE: U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.

MONICA: How did you do?

GEORGE: Piece of cake; hu.

MONICA: What happened to the test?

GEORGE: What? Oh I spilled some food on it.

MONICA: Food? What food?

GEORGE: What are you talking about?

MONICA: Where did you get food?

GEORGE: From my pocket.

MONICA: Your pocket?

GEORGE: I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.

MONICA: And coffee?

GEORGE: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.

MONICA: Where did you get the coffee?

GEORGE: Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)

MONICA: How did you get there?

GEORGE: I walked.

MONICA: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.

GEORGE: I climbed out the window.

MONICA: You climbed out the window?

GEORGE: Of course.

MONICA: Why didn't you go out the door?

GEORGE: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.

MONICA: You're a fascinating man, George Costanza.

(George spreads his arms wide, elbows slightly bent -- his head bobbles a little bit.)
 
 

[Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is looking Dream cafe with binoculars. There's a sign on the window: Closed for renovation.]

JERRY: The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.

ELAINE: You're very special.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.

JERRY: Of course, I always do.

KRAMER: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.

ELAINE: Just give it back to him.

KRAMER: Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)

(Jerry sees George from the window.)

JERRY: Hey Georgie!

GEORGE: Coming up.

JERRY: How'd you do on the IQ test?!

GEORGE: 85!

JERRY: What?!!

GEORGE: 85, Jerry! 85 IQ !

(Jerry laughs, pounding the window sill 3 times with his open palm.)

ELAINE: 85?

JERRY: Well, well, well...

ELAINE: He's coming up?

JERRY: Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.

ELAINE: Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.

JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...

(George comes in looking angry.)

GEORGE: Oh, hello Professor.

ELAINE: George, I cannot believe...

GEORGE: Please...

ELAINE: No there has got be a mistake.

GEORGE: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

JERRY: But an 85?

ELAINE: Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.

JERRY (mocking) It was a madhouse.

ELAINE: Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.

GEORGE: Ooh ho hoo, forget it.

ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?

GEORGE: You could do worse!

ELAINE: No, no, come on. I guarantee it.

GEORGE: All right, I'll ask her.

ELAINE: Ok, now where I'm going to take it.

JERRY: Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu is at the window looking gloomy. Jerry comes in.]

JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.

BABU: You see how I listen. I work very hard, borrow more money.

JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.

BABU: You wish to eat?

JERRY: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.

BABU: Very good.

JERRY (thinking) Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great.
 

[Jerry's apartment. Elaine is finishing the test.]



[Monica's bedroom. George is pacing the room.]
 


[Jerry's monologue.]

You know the IQ test, an they always have that sample question at the beginning where they show you how to fill in the circle. This should be the first elimination point right there. Anybody goes outside that circle,... ?Yeah, you wanna come with us please.   Yeah, yeah you're done, your test is over, you went outside the circle ok??
 


[Jerry's apartment. Elaine finishes the test, slaps down the pencil and stuffs the test back in the envelope.  She checks her watch for the time, stretches her arms above her head.]

ELAINE: (stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.

(Kramer charges in and locks the door behind him.)

ELAINE: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.

ELAINE: What's going on?

MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Hey, Kramer! I saw you go there! I'm not leaving until you gimme that jacket. (Bangs on the door) Open up Kramer!

ELAINE: Wha'd you come in here for?

KRAMER: Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.

(3 more Bangs on the door)

ELAINE: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.

KRAMER: I thought you took the test.

ELAINE: I had to take it again.

KRAMER: How come?

ELAINE: What's the difference?!!

(3 more Bangs on the door)

KRAMER: Well, you can't leave now.

ELAINE: What?

MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!

KRAMER: Never!

(4 more Bangs on the door)
 
 

[Monica's apartment. George is looking out the window.  3 light knocks on the bedroom door]

MONICA: Come on George, open up.

(George anxious and quietly frustrated -- he reluctantly opens the door.)

MONICA: Well?

(George shakes her hand and clasping his left hand over hers -- creating a hand sandwich.)

GEORGE: How' you doing?

MONICA: Where's the test?

GEORGE: Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
 
 

[Dream Cafe. Babu is looking at Jerry as he eats.]

JERRY: Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?

BABU: The shrimp is stringy?

JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator...

BABU: Quiet!!

JERRY: No I...

BABU: You shut up!

JERRY: Well I...

BABU: You make me change restaurant, but nobody come! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!

JERRY: You know, I think I'll just take the check.

BABU: You bad man! You very very bad man! [leaves]

JERRY: (thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
 


[Monica's. Elaine is gently tapping on the bedroom window. Monica comes to open it.]

MONICA: Are you looking for George?

ELAINE: Well eh, kind of....

MONICA: George left.

ELAINE: Oh.

MONICA: Is, that the test?

ELAINE: Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.

MONICA: Thanks. I hope you do a lot better this time.

ELAINE: Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
 


[At the street. Dream Cafe has a Closed sign on the window and men are carrying furniture out.]



[George, Jerry and Kramer are standing across the street. Kramer has no jacket on.]

JERRY: You know what it was, bad location.

GEORGE: Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.

JERRY: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?

KRAMER: h-Yeah...

JERRY: Oh, sorry.

KRAMER: I'm going upstairs.

(Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: Hey guys...

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.

JERRY: 151?

ELAINE: Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)

GEORGE: That's a good score.

JERRY: So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?

GEORGE: Italian.

ELAINE: No, Chinese.

JERRY: You know, what would be great?

(George and Elaine give Jerry a long look.)
 
 

[Closing monologue.]

It's tough to do a good deed. Let's look at your professional good deed doers. Your Lone Rangers, your Superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They're all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, yeah, thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm rentin' here, They got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?"

JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.


[Jerry's apartment]

(A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry doing work with headphones on.)

REPAIRMAN: .....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.

JERRY: Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )

REPAIRMAN: So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration

JERRY: Oh! well whatever you have to do.

REPAIRMAN: I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.

JERRY: (sarcastically) No you don't..

(George enters the apartment.)

GEORGE: Hey! what are listening to?

JERRY: My show from last night.

GEORGE: Oh! you taped it?

JERRY: Yeah , I was doing new material.

GEORGE: Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .

JERRY: Huh?

GEORGE: Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.

JERRY: The" coup dé-toe"

GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.

GEORGE: Need to use the phone.

JERRY: Who you calling?

GEORGE: China.

JERRY: China really?

GEORGE: Yeah. I'll pay for it.

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.

JERRY: Hair?

GEORGE: The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.

JERRY: Done what?

GEORGE: Discovered a cure for baldness.

REPAIRMAN: Did you see that last night?

GEORGE: It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.

JERRY: (to Kramer) What's this?

KRAMER: Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.

GEORGE: Is that the guy who likes fat women?

JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.

KRAMER: (to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.

GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.

KRAMER: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there

JERRY: Oh! my God!....

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.

GEORGE: (George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...

KRAMER: Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)

GEORGE: Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?

JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.

GEORGE: This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?

KRAMER: All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)

GEORGE: WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?

JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.

GEORGE: My god!!!

KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.

GEORGE: All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?

JERRY: Good question.

KRAMER: Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!


[Cut to Monks]

GEORGE: What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?

JERRY: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

ELAINE: Hi boys.

BOTH: Hello...

ELAINE: What's happening?

JERRY: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.

GEORGE: This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......

JERRY: (pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!

GEORGE: What??

JERRY: The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.

GEORGE: I thought you meant the..

JERRY: No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.

ELAINE: What did she say?

PETER: Seinfeld.....( from way in the back of the restaurant. Cheesy plot device to have Jerry leave the table for a minute so George and Elaine can talk)

JERRY: Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)

ELAINE: So did you hear this message?

GEORGE: Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable

ELAINE: Really!

GEORGE: Yeah. I can't get over it.

ELAINE: Huh! Sexy?

GEORGE: This woman drove us out of our minds

ELAINE: Like ...humm...How did she sound?

GEORGE: She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.

ELAINE: Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....

GEORGE: Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....

ELAINE: Shhhhhh!!!

ELAINE: I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?

GEORGE: Oh! no no nothing....

ELAINE: Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.

GEORGE: I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..

ELAINE: Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?

GEORGE: Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing

(Jerry comes back)

JERRY: Remember Peter?

GEORGE: Peter?

JERRY: You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.

ELAINE: So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?

JERRY: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.

ELAINE: Oh! really.

JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.

ELAINE: So what, Are you gonna ask her out.

JERRY: No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.

ELAINE: Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.

GEORGE: Wh.. Where you going?

ELAINE: Home.

GEORGE: Why you going home for?

ELAINE: Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.

JERRY: Sure.


[Back to Jerry's]

GEORGE: Oh! my god. Oh! man...

JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.

ELAINE: (coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.

GEORGE: (phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?

JERRY: Why are you doing this?

GEORGE: Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.

JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: You know what that makes you?...A baldist.

GEORGE: Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?

KRAMER: So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?

GEORGE: In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.

KRAMER: That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?

GEORGE: (visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.

KRAMER: So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?

PING: (continues his phone call) Ha Pachini fair pousher pousher mouist I fai chin fousher...

JERRY: (as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.

[Back to Jerry's.]

JERRY: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...

KRAMER: What is that?

JERRY: That's my cockney accent.

KRAMER: Naw ,na , that's no good.

JERRY: Lets hear yours.

KRAMER: Not bloody likely..

JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.

GEORGE: Guess, what I got.

JERRY: Oh! Is that the bald stuff?

GEORGE: From China. All the way from China.

KRAMER: Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.

GEORGE: No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.

JERRY: Yes I am skeptical.

GEORGE: Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.

KRAMER: W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.

JERRY: No kidding?

KRAMER: He's in jail.

JERRY: What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?

KRAMER: That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)

JERRY: You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?

KRAMER: It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.

JERRY: How long are you suppose to leave it on for?

GEORGE: All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)

JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: It's Elaine Marie Benes.

JERRY: Well Hello..

ELAINE: Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?

JERRY: Yes , I got her number.

GEORGE: Is that Elaine?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: HI ELAINE...

ELAINE: I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?

JERRY: Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business

ELAINE: Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?

GEORGE: Did she say Hello?

JERRY: What? I dunno.

GEORGE: I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?

JERRY: I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.

GEORGE: Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?

JERRY: She's coming up.

GEORGE: Elaine's coming up?

JERRY: Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)

KRAMER: How often do you cut your toe nails?

JERRY: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.

KRAMER: 'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.

JERRY: The big toe; The captain.

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?

JERRY: That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.

(As Jerry dials the girls number, George races to the bathroom one more time.)

ALICIA: Hello.

JERRY: Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.

ALICIA: Yeah.

JERRY: This is Jerry Seinfeld.


[Back to Jerry's after an implied date with Alicia]

JERRY: (to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.

KRAMER: I know how to handle these psychotics.

(George comes in wearing a huge cowboy hat.)

JERRY: Sheriff?........What's with the hat?

GEORGE: Kramer, can we do this later..

KRAMER: No, I got the tape right here.

JERRY: Kramer, let's do this later.

KRAMER: (ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.

GEORGE: Really? ..You think.

JERRY: Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.

KRAMER: 'bout what?

JERRY: It's kinda private.

KRAMER: Like the big toe captain..

GEORGE: So now you're doing my bits?

JERRY: I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!

KRAMER: Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)

JERRY: Does she know?

GEORGE: Because I promised her.

JERRY: I thought you just said she doesn't know??

GEORGE: She doesn't.

JERRY: So how can you promise her?

GEORGE: Because she asked me to.

JERRY: What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?

GEORGE: All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.

JERRY: What, Elaine?

GEORGE: Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.

JERRY: (picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...

GEORGE: Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)

JERRY: Wait a second. .Just give me a second

GEORGE: You heard it fifty times already.

JERRY: She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence

(Door Buzzer)

JERRY: Yeaaaah!!!

ELAINE: (Concerned) What's the matter?

JERRY: Oooh! I got a pain in my side.

ELAINE: (to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)

JERRY: What are you doing here?

ELAINE: I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.

JERRY: I know, George told me.

ELAINE: You told him!!!!

GEORGE: He..He threatened me.

JERRY: Where did you come up with all that stuff?

ELAINE: That was nothing.

GEORGE: Elaine.. I have to tell you something...

JERRY: George NO!!

GEORGE: No no no no no no no..

JERRY: George I'm telling ya..

ELAINE: What is it?

GEORGE: I'm very attracted to you..

JERRY: Aye......

(Kramer comes in and yells)

KRAMER: I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.

GEORGE: Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...

KRAMER: Whoa!!!....That was you?

ELAINE: It was a joke...

KRAMER: Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.

ELAINE: Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...

GEORGE: Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.

JERRY: It's early.

KRAMER: We'll order Chinese.

(She leaves and they all scramble for the tape recorder.)

Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to be two-and-a-half feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, I'd like to get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm allowed up here."


[Jerry and George are at a newsstand]

GEORGE: Where'd you meet her?

JERRY: I met her on an elevator.

GEORGE: On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?

JERRY: Impossible, right?

GEORGE: You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?

JERRY: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.

GEORGE: Wow. What'd you say?

(flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator)

JERRY: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.

(end of flashback)

GEORGE: Wow.

JERRY: Can you believe I did that?

GEORGE: What did she say?

(another flashback)

ISABEL: What crop circles?

(end of flashback)

JERRY: Not a good sign.

GEORGE: Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?

NEWSSTAND OWNER: Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?

JERRY: You got something in your teeth there.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: It's green.

GEORGE: Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.

JERRY: Did you bump into anybody you knew?

GEORGE: I had a job interview.

JERRY: How'd it go?

GEORGE: Take a guess.

(flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's spinached teeth.)

INTERVIEWER: Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.

GEORGE: Ok, thanks.

(end of flashback)

JERRY: What do you need a job, you got Audrey.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: What's the matter?

GEORGE: Oh, nothing.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: You won't think I'm a bad person?

JERRY: Too late for that.

GEORGE: 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.

JERRY: Yeah, she's got a big nose.

GEORGE: I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.

(momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose)

JERRY: It's a schnoz.

GEORGE: Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.

JERRY: A little.

GEORGE: So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.

JERRY: Stop being so concerned with looks.

(momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number)

JERRY: Have you said anything to her about it?

GEORGE: I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.

JERRY: Alright, shut up, here they come.

GEORGE: (waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.


[Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.

ELAINE: Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?

KRAMER: No no, he's never met her. She's in California.

ELAINE: Are you coming with me?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.

GEORGE: Why don't you just commit yourself already?

AUDREY: What is so special about this jacket?

ELAINE: He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.

AUDREY: What's the smudge on your hand?

KRAMER: Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.

GEORGE: What, you didn't wash all day?

KRAMER: Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.

AUDREY: It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.

KRAMER: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.

ELAINE: Kramer!

KRAMER: What? What?

ELAINE: How could you say something like that?!

KRAMER: What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.

ELAINE: No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.

AUDREY: No, it's ok.

ELAINE: What did you have to say that for?

KRAMER: Well, I was just trying to help out.

ELAINE: Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.

KRAMER: You see what happens when you try to be nice?


[Middle Monologue]

But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." "That's ok, your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you very much."


[George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment]

AUDREY: Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?

GEORGE: Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?

AUDREY: You look like you've got something on your mind.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?

AUDREY: How about him?

GEORGE: They way he just says stuff.

AUDREY: He sure does.

GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.

AUDREY: So, what did you think?

GEORGE: About the pizza?

AUDREY: No, about the nose job.

GEORGE: Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?

AUDREY: Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.

GEORGE: Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.

AUDREY: I know, they're good.

GEORGE: Peter Jennings had one.

AUDREY: Really?

GEORGE: Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...

AUDREY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.

AUDREY: I hate the dentist.

GEORGE: It's a cleaning.

AUDREY: So you really think I should do this?

GEORGE: If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.

AUDREY: Well, maybe I should.

GEORGE: What the hell.

ELAINE: (barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?

GEORGE: Me? I didn't say anything.

ELAINE: You encouraged her to get one.

GEORGE: I didn't encourage. No encourage.

ELAINE: Peter Jennings had one?

GEORGE: It's possible.

ELAINE: Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.

AUDREY: No, George is right. I want to get one.

ELAINE: I think it's a mistake.

GEORGE: Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.

 
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop]

GEORGE: I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.

JERRY: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.

GEORGE: (checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.

JERRY: We have time.

GEORGE: It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.

JERRY: It is exciting.

GEORGE: Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...

JERRY: Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.

GEORGE: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.

JERRY: Then what?

GEORGE: He still wins but it's not a blowout.

JERRY: She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.

(flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: (holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.

KRAMER: (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.

(end of flashback)

JERRY: So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.

GEORGE: Good for you.

JERRY: I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.

GEORGE: It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.

JERRY: It's not like that at all.

 
[Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: How do you even know the jacket is there?

KRAMER: Well I don't, I'm guessing.

GEORGE: Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,

AUDREY: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

AUDREY: Enough.

JERRY: Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.

ELAINE: Are you sure you want us here for this?

AUDREY: Yes.

JERRY: Shouldn't a doctor do it?

AUDREY: No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.

GEORGE: Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.

(Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their horror.)

ELAINE: It looks good.

JERRY: Great job.

KRAMER: You got butchered.

(George faints)

(An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.)

JERRY: Let's put him over here.

KRAMER: (to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?

AUDREY: (with hand covering nose) To the doctor!

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.

(Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George.)

ELAINE: How ya feeling?

GEORGE: Too much salt in my diet.

ELAINE: Can I get you anything?

GEORGE: Nah, I'm good.

ELAINE: You sure? Anything?

GEORGE: Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?

ELAINE: No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

GEORGE: It's like, all dented.

ELAINE: Seems to be.

GEORGE: Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--

ELAINE: Shut up, George.

GEORGE: Shut up?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Interesting.

 
[Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal, Jerry has cracked.]

JERRY: Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!

KRAMER: I don't have it, I threw it out.

JERRY: You're lying! You got it, I want that number!

KRAMER: I told you, I threw it out.

JERRY: Give it to me!

KRAMER: You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.

JERRY: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.

KRAMER: You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.

JERRY: I was lying, give it to me!

KRAMER: No, you told me not to!

JERRY: I want that number!

KRAMER: Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!

(Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl, then storms out again.)


[George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose, George is trying not to look at it.]

AUDREY: The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...

GEORGE: Yeah.

AUDREY: You see this perinasal sinus cavity?

GEORGE: Oh, I got it.

AUDREY: You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.

GEORGE: Yeah, phew.

AUDREY: So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?

GEORGE: What?

AUDREY: Remember we talked about taking a trip together?

GEORGE: We did?

AUDREY: Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?

GEORGE: Hawaii?

AUDREY: Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.

GEORGE: (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.

AUDREY: I never heard that.

GEORGE: Oh yeah. My friend lived there.

AUDREY: We could go to the Caribbean.

GEORGE: You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.

AUDREY: George, I don't think this is working.


[Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.]

ISABEL: Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.

JERRY: I'm Nelson!

ISABEL: That's not the line, Jerry.

JERRY: Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.

ISABEL: I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.

JERRY: Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.

ISABEL: Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.

JERRY: (to himself: Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.

(Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.)

JERRY'S BRAIN: Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?

JERRY'S PENIS: Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!

JERRY'S BRAIN: I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.

JERRY'S PENIS: Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.

JERRY'S BRAIN: What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.

JERRY'S PENIS: Oh, go read a book.

JERRY'S BRAIN: Enough chatting, let's play.


[Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.]

ELAINE: You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.

KRAMER: (filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?

ELAINE: Yeah.

KRAMER: Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.

ELAINE: What do I need this for?

KRAMER: Because we're engaged.

ELAINE: We're engaged?

KRAMER: Um hm.

ELAINE: Kramer, this is too big.

KRAMER: (lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.

(A stout man walks around the corner.)

LANDLORD: Hello?

ELAINE: Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.

LANDLORD: Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?

KRAMER: Yes, yes I am.

LANDLORD: I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.

KRAMER: Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.

LANDLORD: Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?

KRAMER: My contention?

LANDLORD: Yes, your contention.

KRAMER: Yes, that's my contention.

ELAINE: I heard him contend that.

LANDLORD: It's too bad about your father.

ELAINE: Oh, it was a frame-up.

LANDLORD: A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.

ELAINE: Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.

KRAMER: She does fine work.

LANDLORD: Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.

ELAINE: How kind of you.

LANDLORD: You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.

(Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.)

(Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have the upper hand.)

JERRY'S BRAIN: What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!

ISABEL: Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.

JERRY'S PENIS: It's killing me. (Makes a move)

JERRY'S BRAIN: That's your move?

JERRY'S PENIS: Yeah.

JERRY'S BRAIN: Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!

JERRY'S PENIS: (beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!

(Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop)

JERRY'S BRAIN: (before disappearing himself) Punk.

JERRY: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.

(Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face)

 

[Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment]

ELAINE: Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.

LANDLORD: He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.

ELAINE: My father, really? I had no idea.

LANDLORD: Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs

Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken stumblebum.

KRAMER: You don't say?

ELAINE: I found it!

LANDLORD: The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!"

(Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated. Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.)

 
[The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.]

KRAMER: So I grabbed the guy by the collar.

ELAINE: Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"

JERRY: So I assume the jig was up.

ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much.

(Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful)

AUDREY: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hey.

AUDREY: (to George) Hello.

GEORGE: (smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!

AUDREY: (motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.

ELAINE: So, will I see you later tonight?

AUDREY: Not sure.

KRAMER: (rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?

AUDREY: (holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.

KRAMER: Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.

ELAINE: (after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--

GEORGE: (interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.


[Closing Monologue]

The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to perform a cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."

So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication.  You ever try and pick one of these out?  It's not easy.  It's a wall.  It's an entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright, alright, alright, okay, what the hell--  This is quick acting, but this is long lasting.  When do I need to feel good, now or later?"  It's a tough question. And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong with the guy, you know?  They always show you, like, all the problems that he's having.  First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this guy.  No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public.  And he's always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him. I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?"  "Yes I am."  "Are you having any lightning with the pain?"


[Jerry and George are in a drug store.]

JERRY:  How did you get fleas?

GEORGE:  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.

JERRY:  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.

GEORGE:  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?

JERRY:  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"

GEORGE:  You know Ava's gonna be there.

JERRY:  Who?

GEORGE:  The nice one that works in my office.

JERRY:  Nah.

GEORGE:  I'll drive.

JERRY:  Oh, well, now you're talking.

GEORGE:  It's supposed to be a good party.

JERRY:  What does that mean, good dip?

GEORGE:  No, there'll be girls there.

JERRY:  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?

GEORGE:  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between these two?  (They each grab a box and check the ingredients)  You got propylparabin?

JERRY:  Got it.

GEORGE:  You got isobutane-30?

JERRY:  I got isobutane-20.

GEORGE:  A-ha.

JERRY:  You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?

GEORGE:  Got it.

JERRY:  I have aloe!

GEORGE:  You got aloe?  I love aloe.

JERRY:  Where do they make yours?

GEORGE:  Jersey.

JERRY:  White Plains.

(George puts down the "Jersey" box and grabs the "White Plains" box from Jerry and they go to the check out counter.  Two women are standing at the magazine rack in the background.)

JERRY:  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.  What's the matter?

GEORGE:  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.

JERRY:  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.

GEORGE: (to the cashier)  Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.

CASHIER:  You gave me a ten.

GEORGE:  I'm positive I gave you a twenty.

CASHIER:  I know what you gave me.

GEORGE:  You owe me ten dollars.

CASHIER:  Will you please step aside?  Next?

GEORGE:  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--

CASHIER:  You.

GEORGE:  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.

SECURITY GUARD:  What's the problem here?

GEORGE:  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.

CASHIER:  He's claiming short.

SECURITY GUARD:  Alright, let's just take it outside.

GEORGE:  Oh, so you don't believe me either?

SECURITY GUARD:  Come on, let's go.

GEORGE:  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.


[George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door]

ELAINE:  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.

JERRY:  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.

GEORGE: (waving:  Eva.

(A beautiful woman starts walking over.)

JERRY:  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.

AVA:  So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.

GEORGE:  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?

AVA:  Yesterday

GEORGE:  I don't believe it.

AVA:  Ask Mark.

GEORGE:  Mark, is this true?

(A man across the room nods.  George and Ava walk towards him.)

JERRY:  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.

ELAINE:  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.

JERRY:  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.

ELAINE:  How old are you?

JERRY:  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting.

ELAINE:  Whatever you want.

(Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.)

GUY:  You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?

JERRY:  Yeah, yeah I did.

GUY:  So what do you do?

JERRY: (Patting his head:  I'm a comedian.

GUY:  Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?

JERRY: (still Patting)  I hear a voice.

GUY:  What kind of voice?

JERRY:  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.

GUY:  How come you keep tapping your head.

JERRY:  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.

(Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.)

GUY:  On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for something.

(Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.)

GUY:  Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.

(Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.)

GUY:  I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.

ELAINE:  Yeah, me too.

GUY:  Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.

(Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.)

GEORGE:  How's it going?

JERRY:  Great, how about you?

GEORGE:  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.

JERRY:  How do you account for this?

GEORGE:  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.

JERRY:  Well, she obviously liked you all along.

GEORGE:  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."

JERRY:  Anyway, I'm ready to go.

GEORGE:  Now?

JERRY:  If not now, when?

GEORGE:  Gimme a half-hour.

JERRY:  Okay, half-hour.

(Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from tapping.)

GUY:  Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...

JERRY: (interrupting)  Can I talk to you for a second?

ELAINE:  Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.

JERRY:  Hey, I was dying over there.

ELAINE:  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.

(Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.)

ELLEN:  Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?

JERRY:  Right.

ELLEN:  Yeah, I remember you.

(Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch near a pretentious woman.)

WOMAN:  I wonder what happened to my fiancé.  I know he's here somewhere. Ellen?  Have you seen my fiancé?

ELLEN:  He's upstairs.

WOMAN:  Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.  I havelost my fiancé, the poor baby.

ELAINE:  Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

WOMAN:  What?

ELAINE:  The dingo ate your baby!

(Cut to George and Jerry.)

JERRY:  You ready?

GEORGE:  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.

JERRY:  I do favors.

GEORGE:  I think something's happening here.

JERRY:  What?

GEORGE:  I think she wants me to take her home.

JERRY:  Wow.

GEORGE:  What should I do?

JERRY:  Go!  What could you do?

GEORGE:  What about you and Elaine?

JERRY:  We'll get a ride.

GEORGE:  Are you sure?

JERRY:  We'll be fine, what did she say?

GEORGE:  She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes)  She told me she wants me to make love to her.

JERRY:  What?  She said that?

GEORGE:  Yeah.

JERRY:  Get out of here.

GEORGE:  I swear.

JERRY:  What did you say?

GEORGE:  I, I, I can't.

JERRY:  What did you say?

GEORGE:  Please, it's--

JERRY:  What?

GEORGE:  I... I... I long for you.

JERRY:  I long for you?

GEORGE:  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.

JERRY:  It's okay, that's not bad.

GEORGE:  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.

JERRY:  Really?

GEORGE:  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?

JERRY:  Oh, come on.

GEORGE:  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.

JERRY:  George, you're thinking too much.

GEORGE:  I know, I know, I can't stop it!

(Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.)

ELAINE:  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.

JERRY: (walking up)  Pendant?  Those bastards.

ELAINE:  Excuse me.

JERRY:  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office

ELAINE:  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?

JERRY:  Uh, no, he's taking the car.

ELAINE:  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?

JERRY:  I don't know.

ELAINE:  You don't know?

JERRY:  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

ELAINE:  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?

JERRY:  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.


[Middle monologue]

All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  This is the male code.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad.  They hold that countdown.  He's leaning against the rocket talking to her, "So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"


[Still at the Party]

ELAINE: (noticing Ava in a fur)  Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?

JERRY:  Yeah, yeah, alright.

ELAINE:  I can't believe she's walking around in that.

JERRY:  Just don't make a scene.

ELAINE:  Hey, is that real fur?

JERRY:  Oh boy.

AVA:  It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.

GEORGE:  Yeah, good night.

ELAINE:  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?

GEORGE:  Could we talk about this some other time?

AVA:  Are you a vegetarian?

JERRY:  Here we go.

ELAINE:  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.

AVA:  So you're a hypocrite.

GEORGE:  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-

AVA:  Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.

ELAINE:  Fish don't feel any pain.

AVA:  How do you know?  Do you communicate with fish?

ELAINE:  Well, they're not kept in little cages.

AVA:  Ever seen a goldfish?

GEORGE:  Goldfish.

ELAINE:  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.

AVA:  Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life.  (To George)  Let's go.

ELAINE:  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!

GEORGE:  That's why we're here in America.

JERRY:  You're beautiful.

ELAINE:  Call Kramer.

JERRY:  Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, this is your party, right?

STEVE:  No, I just live here.

JERRY:  Can I use your phone?

STEVE:  What's in it for me?

JERRY:  A bigger bill?

STEVE:  He he, go for it.

(Jerry picks up the phone and dials.)

JERRY:  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.

(Cut to several hours later.  The party has ended.  The hosts, Steve and Jenny, are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.)

ELAINE:  You sure you don't need any help?

JENNY:  No, not really.

JERRY:  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

JENNY: (To Steve)  I want them out of here.

ELAINE:  Call him again.

JERRY:  I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.

JENNY: (To Steve)  It's two o'clock in the morning.

JERRY: (noticing a coffee table book)  Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.

ELAINE:  Six hundred and twenty million people died.

JERRY:  Thousand.

ELAINE:  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror. (To Jerry)  The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the right directions?

JERRY:  Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's nothing we can do?

JENNY:  No!  (To Steve)  I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.

JERRY:  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.

ELAINE:  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.

JENNY:  You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.

JERRY:  Oh, he's coming.

JENNY:  Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.

(Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.)

JERRY:  That's him.

JENNY:  I'm going to bed!

ELAINE:  Thanks a lot.

JERRY:  Thanks, great party.

(As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.)

KRAMER:  Hey, how ya doing?

STEVE:  Ah, look who's here.

KRAMER:  I'm sorry.

JERRY:  Hey, it's okay.

KRAMER:  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.

ELAINE:  Then how did you find the place?

KRAMER:  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.  8173.

JERRY:  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.

STEVE:  No problem.

JERRY:  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.

STEVE:  Hey, I might take you up on that.

JERRY: (writing)  Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.

KRAMER: (to Elaine)  You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.

ELAINE:  But it's cold out.

KRAMER:  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.


[Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.]

JERRY:  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.

(Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.)

JERRY:  Who is it?

VOICE:  Mr. Pocatello.

JERRY:  Who?

VOICE:  You mean you don't recognize my voice?

(Jerry opens the door.  Steve steps in.)

STEVE:  Jerry, baby!

JERRY:  Do I know you?

STEVE:  Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.

JERRY:  I'm sorry, uh-

STEVE:  See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.

JERRY:  Oh, okay.

STEVE:  You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.

JERRY:  You certainly are.  What's going on?

STEVE:  I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.

JERRY:  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.

STEVE:  Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.

JERRY:  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.

STEVE:  I understand.

JERRY:  Look, you can hang out here if you want.

STEVE:  Don't be so enthusiastic.

JERRY:  No, it's-

STEVE:  I'm not gonna steal anything.

JERRY:  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.

STEVE:  I think I can do that.

JERRY:  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.

STEVE:  Yeah.  Let's have lunch.


[Jerry and George are at the drug store.]

JERRY:  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.

GEORGE:  Yeah, me either.

JERRY:  Oh, come on.

GEORGE:  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?

JERRY:  I've never had a job.

GEORGE:  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.

JERRY:  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?

GEORGE:  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'

JERRY:  What are you gonna do?

GEORGE:  I have no choice, I'm quitting.


[Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV.  Kramer walks in and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.]

KRAMER:  The party, Long Island?

STEVE:  Kramer, right?

KRAMER:  Hey, what are you doing here?

STEVE:  I'm waiting for my ride.

KRAMER:  Where's Jerry?

STEVE:  He split.  Let me ask you something.  Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?

KRAMER:  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.  (Sensing Steve's disappointment)  Well, but I might have something.


[Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.  Jerry is selecting medication.]

JERRY:  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.

GEORGE:  How much is that?

JERRY:  Nine sixty.

GEORGE:  Nine sixty?  Give it to me.

JERRY:  Why?

GEORGE:  Don't worry, I got it.

JERRY:  What do you mean, you got it?

GEORGE:  I got it.

(George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket)

JERRY:  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're stealing this, aren't you?

GEORGE:  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.

JERRY:  You're a lunatic.

GEORGE:  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.

JERRY:  What do you say to a person like you?

GEORGE:  Just walk.

JERRY:  Oh.

(A security guard approaches George.)

SECURITY GUARD:  Scuse me.  What do you got there?

GEORGE:  What?

SECURITY GUARD:  What do you got in your shirt?

GEORGE:  Oh, I was gonna pay for this.

SECURITY GUARD: (grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me.

GEORGE: (nervous)  Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.

CASHIER: um-hmm.

SECURITY GUARD:  You don't think I remember you?

GEORGE: (more nervous)  What are you talking about?

SECURITY GUARD:  I know who you are, I was watching you.

GEORGE: (panicky)  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?

(The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.)

JERRY:  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?


[Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.  Kramer is in the middle of a story.]

KRAMER:  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!

(They both erupt in raucous laughter.)

STEVE: (hysterical)  Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?

KRAMER:  Not really.

STEVE:  Maybe we should call one of those escort services.  I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.

KRAMER: (handing Steve the phone)  555-LOVE.

STEVE:  Hey, you want in on this?

KRAMER:  No, I got a girl in the next building


[Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's voice from inside.]

VOICE:  Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it.  Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do.

STEVE: (drunk and slurring)  Oh Jerry!  Jerry!  Look who's here, it's Jerry

JERRY:  What the hell?

STEVE:  Jerry, this is Patti.

JERRY:  Nice to meet you.

PATTI:  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.

JERRY:  What the hell is going on here?

STEVE:  I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.  (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.

PATTI:  I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.

STEVE:  See ya, Jerr.  And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.

JERRY:  Oh, Kramer huh?

STEVE:  Yeah, he's a hoot.  Oh, goodbye, my dear.  (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away)  Ouch.  (To Jerry)  Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.

(Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.)

PATTI:  I ain't leaving.

JERRY:  Patti?

PATTI:  You got anything to drink?

JERRY:  Alright, how much does he owe you?

PATTI:  Fifty dollars.

JERRY: (taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly)  Fifty dollars.

(In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.)

COP:  This your apartment?

JERRY:  Yeah, but--

COP:  You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.

JERRY:  Wait a second, I--

(Elaine walks in.)

ELAINE:  I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti)  Is that real fur?

JERRY & COP:  Oh boy.


[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.]

GEORGE:  You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.

JERRY:  He was a nice guy.

GEORGE:  Oh, great guy.

JERRY:  Was there a red-headed guy there?

GEORGE:  The one with the long sideburns?

JERRY:  Yeah.

GEORGE:  Where does he come off?

JERRY:  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.

GEORGE:  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.

JERRY:  Oh, we all hated him.


[Closing monologue]

There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor.  You can measure the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do me a favor.'  Small favor, small pause.  Can you do me a favor, hand me that pencil?  No pause at all.  Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...' (huge pause, followed by closing credits.)

Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it, it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would like a car alarm like that.


[Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.

GEORGE: Was the alarm on?

JERRY: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.

GEORGE: I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?

JERRY: They cross the wires or something.

GEORGE: Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

(Kramer enters.)

JERRY: They stole my car.

KRAMER: Who did?

JERRY: They did.

KRAMER: Was it more than just one?

JERRY: What should I do, should I call the police?

KRAMER: What are they gonna do?

JERRY: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.

GEORGE: Maybe you should call your car phone.

JERRY: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.

JERRY: Are you serious?

GEORGE: Yeah, go ahead, call.

JERRY: I don't even know if I remember the number.

(Jerry dials.)

JERRY: What do I say if he picks up?

CAR THIEF: Hello?

JERRY: Hello? Is this 555-8383?

CAR THIEF: I have no idea.

JERRY: Can I ask you a question?

CAR THIEF: Sure.

JERRY: Did you steal my car?

CAR THIEF: Yes I did.

JERRY: You did?!

CAR THIEF: I did.

JERRY: That's my car!

CAR THIEF: I didn't know it was yours.

JERRY: What are you gonna do with it?

CAR THIEF: I dunno, drive around.

JERRY: Then can I have it back?

CAR THIEF: Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.

(Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.)

KRAMER: Hello?

CAR THIEF: Yeah, who's this?

KRAMER: Kramer.

CAR THIEF: Hello, Kramer.

KRAMER: Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.

CAR THIEF: Wait, hold on... Brown ones?

KRAMER: Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.

CAR THIEF: One-two-nine, okay.

KRAMER: Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.

JERRY: (derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?

CAR THIEF: Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?

CAR THIEF: I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.

JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

CAR THIEF: Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--

(Jerry hangs up.)

JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car.

GEORGE: Who's Sid?

JERRY: He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

JERRY: He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.

GEORGE: What, do you pay him for that?

JERRY: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.

GEORGE: How many people does he do that for?

JERRY: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.

KRAMER: He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?

GEORGE: Could anybody do that?

(Sid enters.)

JERRY: Hey Sid, what happened?

SID: I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.

JERRY: You left the keys in the car?

SID: Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.

KRAMER: You know I'm in that movie?

GEORGE: You are?

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm an extra.

GEORGE: How'd you get that?

KRAMER: Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.

GEORGE: Right out of the clear blue sky?

KRAMER: Clear blue sky!

GEORGE: Well, why didn't they ask me?

KRAMER: I got a quality.

SID: Jerry, you got insurance, right?

JERRY: Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

SID: Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.

JERRY: This Wednesday?

SID: No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.

JERRY: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.

SID: If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.

GEORGE: Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?

SID: Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.

GEORGE: Maybe I could move them until you get back.

SID: What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?

GEORGE: I'm in a transition phase right now.

SID: Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.

(Phone rings.)

JERRY: Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.


[Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.]

ELAINE: I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.

JERRY: Owen March, I never heard of him.

ELAINE: Well, he's not a baseball player.

JERRY: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.

ELAINE: Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

JERRY: What's that?

ELAINE: He's sixty-six years old.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Next please.

ELAINE: Well, go, go.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Can I help you? Name please?

JERRY: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Okay, let's see here.

JERRY: Sixty-six years old?

ELAINE: Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.

JERRY: Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?

ELAINE: What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?

JERRY: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

JERRY: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

JERRY: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: I know why we have reservations.

JERRY: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.

(The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen speaking with someone.)

JERRY: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.

ELAINE: Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?

JERRY: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.

ELAINE: Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.

(The agent returns.)

RENTAL CAR AGENT: I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.

JERRY: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: But we do have a compact if you would like that.

JERRY: Fine.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?

JERRY: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Please fill this out.

ELAINE: What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?

JERRY: Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.

ELAINE: I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.


[Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: I just don't enjoy being with him.

JERRY: Well that's what's important.

ELAINE: I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?

JERRY: How many times you been out with him?

ELAINE: Seven?

JERRY: Face to face.

ELAINE: Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?

JERRY: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.

ELAINE: Hmm... How's the pasta over there?

Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way and heads for the kitchen sink.

KRAMER: Whoa, whoa!!

JERRY: What is going on out there?

GEORGE: I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!

(George runs off into the bathroom.)

KRAMER: Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?

ELAINE: Today?!

KRAMER: You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.

ELAINE: Yeah.

KRAMER: So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.

ELAINE: He was laughing?!

KRAMER: Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.

JERRY: So then what?

KRAMER: I got a line in the movie!

ELAINE: Get out!

JERRY: That's great!

GEORGE: You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?

KRAMER: Pretty good, huh?

GEORGE: You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?

JERRY: You mean *a* career.

ELAINE: So was Mia Farrow there?

KRAMER: Uh, I didn't see him.

ELAINE: What's your line?

KRAMER: Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?

(The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.)

KRAMER: So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."

GEORGE: Is that how you're gonna say it?

KRAMER: No, no, I'm working on it.

ELAINE: Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

JERRY: No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

KRAMER: No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.

GEORGE: "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"

(Jerry pinches his nose.)

GEORGE: That was no good?

KRAMER: I didn't say anything.

ELAINE: I'm gonna go break up with Owen.

GEORGE: What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!

(George storms out.)


[Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.]

JERRY: Oh my god.

ELAINE: Call an ambulance.

JERRY: Boy, he took it hard.


[Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.]

ELAINE: We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.

JERRY: (on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.

ELAINE: Tell then to hurry! Hurry!

JERRY: (To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.

JERRY: Kramer.

KRAMER: What happened here?

ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?

JERRY: Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?

ELAINE: What extremities?

KRAMER: What's an extremity?

JERRY: You raise the feet, get blood to the head.

KRAMER: You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.

ELAINE: Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.

JERRY: I don't have a washcloth.

ELAINE: Well use a paper towel.

JERRY: You can't put a paper towel on his head.

KRAMER: What about a big sponge?

JERRY: How you gonna hold it on there?

KRAMER: Use a belt.

ELAINE: No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.

JERRY: Should we walk him around?

ELAINE and KRAMER: (at the same time) Yes, yes.

KRAMER: Yeah, I've seen them do that.

JERRY: No, no that's for a drug overdose.

KRAMER: Maybe that's what he's got.

ELAINE: No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.

KRAMER: Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.

ELAINE: He is not a drug addict!

JERRY: Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.

ELAINE: A cookie!

KRAMER: Can you give him a cookie?

ELAINE: How's he gonna chew it?

JERRY: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.

(Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.)

ELAINE: Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.

KRAMER: I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.

ELAINE: You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.

JERRY: Cookies don't liquefy.

ELAINE: Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.

KRAMER: Alright I'll get a blender.

JERRY: What blender? I don't have a blender.

KRAMER: You got a blender.

JERRY: I would know if I had a blender.

ELAINE: Where is the ambulance?!

(Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a crashing sound.)

(The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.)

JERRY: (on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.

ELAINE: I can't believe what's going on out here.

JERRY: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?

VOICE: Paramedics.

JERRY: Come on up. Okay, they're here.

ELAINE: He seems to be breathing.

JERRY: Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?

ELAINE: Almost.

JERRY: Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.

ELAINE: It's not an easy thing to bring up.

JERRY: Yeah, that's true.

ELAINE: Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.

JERRY: Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.

ELAINE: He does, how'd you know that?

JERRY: I could tell.

(Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.)

ELAINE: What happened, what took you so long?!

PARAMEDIC: We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort.

JERRY: Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!

(George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.)

GEORGE: Oh man.

JERRY: What happened to the car?

GEORGE: Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?

ELAINE: This guy I'm seeing.

GEORGE: What happened?

JERRY: We don't know!

PARAMEDIC: Who put cookies in his mouth?

JERRY and ELAINE: Cookies?

PARAMEDIC: You're not supposed to do that.

JERRY: So how'd you hit the car?

GEORGE: I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.

JERRY: It's not even my car, it's a rental.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.

GEORGE: Woody mentioned me? What did he say?

KRAMER: He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'

GEORGE: Should I apologize to Woody?

KRAMER: Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.


[Middle Monologue]

What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment. Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid. They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.'


[Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment.]

SID: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.

GEORGE: Well I know how to drive.

SID: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.

JERRY: Can I get anybody anything?

SID: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?

GEORGE: I put my pants on, Sid.

SID: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.

GEORGE: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.

SID: Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.

GEORGE: Maybe I could call my father.

(Kramer enters holding a newspaper.)

KRAMER: Hey, you seen the paper yet?

JERRY: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.

KRAMER: Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.

JERRY: (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.

KRAMER: Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.

JERRY: (continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.

SID: Oh lord.

JERRY: (finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.


[Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of pretzels.]

ELAINE: Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'

JERRY: Can he communicate?

ELAINE: Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.

JERRY: Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.

ELAINE: So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.

JERRY: What community? There's a community?

ELAINE: Of course there's a community.

JERRY: All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.

JERRY: Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident.

JERRY: That is right, somebody else was driving.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.

JERRY: Uh huh, what's that?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: You're not covered for other drivers.

JERRY: Other drivers?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Um hm.

JERRY: Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Not that particular one.

JERRY: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--

JERRY: Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?

RENTAL CAR AGENT: Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.

JERRY: These pretzels are making me thirsty.


[Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup]

ELAINE: Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.


[Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.]

ELAINE: Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?

JERRY: An overdose of odor? Good question.

GEORGE: Do I smell?

ELAINE: No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.

JERRY: Ahh.

GEORGE: He's alright?

ELAINE: Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.

(The waitress brings the check.)

JERRY: Let me get that.

GEORGE: No no no, I got it.

JERRY: Please.

GEORGE: No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,

JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.

(Kramer enters and sits down.)

JERRY: What are you doing here?

KRAMER: I got fired from the movie.

GEORGE: Get out of here, why?

KRAMER: Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.

ELAINE: Aww.

KRAMER: Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.

(Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.)

JERRY: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.


[Closing monologue]

I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And the best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to get married, you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, all I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. Do you take this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. Rest of the time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the sniffles, you better be there.

JERRY: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?


[At a party]

JERRY: Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.

GEORGE: Like you do.

JERRY: Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?

GEORGE: What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?

JERRY: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?

GEORGE: Why did France give that to us anyway?

JERRY: It was a gift.

GEORGE: So countries just exchange gifts like that?

JERRY: If they like each other.

GEORGE: There's Elaine.

JERRY: See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.

GEORGE: Really? They work here in the office?

JERRY: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.

GEORGE: Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.

JERRY: You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.

GEORGE: "Off the wagon"?

JERRY: I think it's off the wagon.

GEORGE: I think it's "on the wagon".

ELAINE: Jerry, George, what are you doing here?

JERRY: What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)

ELAINE: *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)

JERRY: Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.

ELAINE: Where did you find it?

JERRY: Under the sofa cushion.

ELAINE: And you stopped by just to give it to me?

JERRY: It's your Christmas present.

ELAINE: I though I'd never find it.

GEORGE: Well today's your lucky day.

ELAINE: No. Today's *your* lucky day.

GEORGE: It will be my first one.

ELAINE: You want to work here?

GEORGE: Huh?

ELAINE: Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.

DICK: Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?

JERRY: "The guy?"

ELAINE: (softly to Dick) Dick.

GEORGE: How can you just get it?

ELAINE: My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.

JERRY: Cranberry juice?

ELAINE: And vodka.

DICK: I got the cranberry juice.

DICK: So... you're Jerry.

JERRY: So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)

MR. LIPPMAN: (What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?

GEORGE: Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.

MR. LIPPMAN: How do you read?

GEORGE: I like Mike Lubika.

MR. LIPPMAN: Mike Lubika?

GEORGE: He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...

MR. LIPPMAN: No, no, no. I mean authors.

GEORGE: Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.

MR. LIPPMAN: Name a couple.

GEORGE: Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.

MR. LIPPMAN: Art Vandelay?

GEORGE: He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.

MR. LIPPMAN: What has he written?

GEORGE: Venetian Blinds.

DICK: (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.

JERRY: Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.

ELAINE: Where's my drink?

JERRY: There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?

GEORGE: I think he was impressed.

ELAINE: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.

JERRY: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

ELAINE: Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.

JERRY: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.

ELAINE: One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.

GEORGE: Told you.


[At a clothing store]

JERRY: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.

GEORGE: Do I really have to buy her something?

JERRY: Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?

GEORGE: What is that? Is that cashmere?

JERRY: Yeah. She would love cashmere.

GEORGE: Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.

JERRY: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.

GEORGE: Wow. Excuse me, Miss?

SALES WOMAN: Yes?

GEORGE: How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?

SALES WOMAN: (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.

GEORGE: What? I don't see anything.

SALES WOMAN: See this red dot?

GEORGE: Oh yeah.

JERRY: Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)

GEORGE: (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?

SALES WOMAN: There's no exchanges on this.

GEORGE: You think she would care about the red dot?

JERRY: It's hard to say.

GEORGE: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?

JERRY: Well I can see it.

GEORGE: Yeah, but you know where it is.

JERRY: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?

GEORGE: Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?

JERRY: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.

GEORGE: Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?

JERRY: You want me to take an overview?

GEORGE: Please.

JERRY: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Yeah so?

ELAINE: He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.

JERRY: Oh boy, can you smell it?

ELAINE: No. I can't smell it.

JERRY: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.

ELAINE: You don't always smell someone from a drink.

JERRY: Yes you do.

ELAINE: What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?

JERRY: Yes you would.

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?

KRAMER: Okay.

JERRY: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?

KRAMER: You can smell me without the drink.

ELAINE: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.

KRAMER: Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?

JERRY: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.

(Kramer drinks.)

KRAMER: All right.

(Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.)

JERRY: I don't smell anything.

ELAINE: Maybe we're too close to the bottle.

(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: (over the speaker) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.

GEORGE: Hello everybody.

KRAMER: Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.

GEORGE: (uncomfortablly) Thank you.

ELAINE: Hey what's that?

GEORGE: It's an early Christmas present.

ELAINE: Christmas present? For who?

GEORGE: For you.

ELAINE: *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.

KRAMER: Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...

JERRY: Kramer. Yeah that'll do.

ELAINE: (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?

GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.

ELAINE: Oh, I love cashmere.

GEORGE: Well who doesn't.

ELAINE: My, George this must have cost a fortune.

GEORGE: Ahh, money.

ELAINE: Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?

JERRY: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.

ELAINE: George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.

GEORGE: Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.

KRAMER: What's that red dot on your sweater?

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.

ELAINE: Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.

GEORGE: What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?

JERRY: (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.

ELAINE: What don't you know?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: Well do you see it or don't you?

JERRY: Ahem. Say that again?

ELAINE: Do you see it or don't you?

JERRY: Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.

(Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.)

JERRY: Now what did you ask me again.

(Kramer is snoring.)


[At the office. Elaine is walking by]

ELAINE: You're still here. You're a dynamo.

GEORGE: I can't believe I get paid for this.

ELAINE: I'll see you tomorrow.

(Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.)

GEORGE: How you doing?

CLEANING WOMAN: Hello.

(The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning.)


[At Monk's]

JERRY: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?

GEORGE: Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.

JERRY: Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.

GEORGE: Why is that?

JERRY: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.

GEORGE: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)

JERRY: Convulsing?

GEORGE: Convulsing?

JERRY: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.

GEORGE: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.

JERRY: You don't drink.

GEORGE: I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.

JERRY: So you started drinking.

GEORGE: So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.

JERRY: So how was it?

GEORGE: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.

JERRY: Good thing the cleaning lady was there.


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: Dick was fired.

JERRY: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.

ELAINE: You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?

JERRY: What are you saying?

ELAINE: I'm not saying anything.

JERRY: You're saying something.

ELAINE: What could I be saying?

JERRY: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.

ELAINE: If I was saying something I would have said it.

JERRY: Well why don't you say it?

ELAINE: I said it.

JERRY: What did you say?

ELAINE: Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.

(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: (over the speaker) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up.

ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.

JERRY: No I didn't.

ELAINE: Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.

JERRY: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.

ELAINE: How much did he save?

JERRY: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.

(Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.)

GEORGE: I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.

JERRY: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.

GEORGE: Did you tell her anything?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Do you swear?

JERRY: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.

GEORGE: Oh you told her didn't you.

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?

GEORGE: What? Did I what?

ELAINE: You did didn't you.

GEORGE: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.

ELAINE: Well Jerry told me that you did.

GEORGE: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.

JERRY: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.

GEORGE: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.


[At the office.]

GEORGE: This is for you.

CLEANING WOMAN: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.

GEORGE: As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.

CLEANING WOMAN: Okay, okay, can I open it now?

GEORGE: Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.

CLEANING WOMAN: Oh! Is that cashmere?

GEORGE: Of course it's cashemere.

CLEANING WOMAN: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!

GEORGE: Just a little something for Christmas.

CLEANING WOMAN: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, "what do you call this most beautiful fabric?", and he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked if I could have it, and he said "No. Get away from me." Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.

GEORGE: I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.

CLEANING WOMAN: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.

GEORGE: Take it off. You're going to ruin it.

CLEANING WOMAN: (noticing the dot) What's this?


[At the comedy club]

JERRY: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.

DICK: The only stench is comming from you.

AUDIENCE: Oooooh.

JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.

DICK: It's off the wagon.

JERRY: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?

DICK: I don't know.

JERRY: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?

DICK: You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.

JERRY: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?

DICK: What the hell do you know about wagons?

JERRY: I know enough not to get on them.


[In the Lippman's office.]

MR. LIPPMAN: I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?

GEORGE: Who said that?

MR. LIPPMAN: She did.

GEORGE: Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.

MR. LIPPMAN: You're fired.

GEORGE: Well you didn't have to say it like that.

MR. LIPPMAN: I want you out of here by the end of the day.

GEORGE: What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?

MR. LIPPMAN: Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.

(He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office "wearing" it. )


[In the hall of the office]

ELAINE: You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.

GEORGE: You never had sex in the office before?

ELAINE: No. I once made out with someone but that was it.

GEORGE: Alright so you made out with someone.

ELAINE: Well that's not sex.

GEORGE: Kissing is sex.

ELAINE: Kissing is not sex.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Jerry.

ELAINE: Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Over here.

ELAINE: What are you doing here?

JERRY: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.

ELAINE: Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?

JERRY: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.

ELAINE: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

JERRY: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.

*crash*

DICK: Merry Christmas.

ELAINE: Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.

GEORGE: Hide, hide under the desk.

ELAINE: Ow, ow move over.

JERRY: Get off of me.

ELAINE: I've got no room.

(Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.)

DICK: Is that cashmere?

GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.

DICK: (noticing the dot) What's this?


[At the comedy club]

JERRY: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.

DICK: You mean on the wagon.

JERRY: Don't get smart.

[Monk's Café, the whole gang at a booth]

KRAMER: All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.

ELAINE: Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?

KRAMER: Well, yeah...

ELAINE: Ok, what time is your job interview George?

GEORGE: 9:45

JERRY: Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.

GEORGE: What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.

ELAINE: All right, I'm gonna go.

JERRY: What time is the lesbian wedding?

ELAINE: 9:30

GEORGE: Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?

ELAINE: Yeah, they flip a coin.

GEORGE: What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.

JERRY: I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)

GEORGE: I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: "That's why I'm not heterosexual".

KRAMER: Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.

JERRY: Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.


[On the Subway]

GEORGE: How many tickets are you paying today?

KRAMER: Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)

GEORGE: No doors?

KRAMER: I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.

(Blind violinist comes playing, with mug for the money. Everybody else gives him some change, except George)

GEORGE: I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.

VIOLIN PLAYER: Thank you.

GEORGE: That guy is not blind.

JERRY: So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?

GEORGE: I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.

JERRY: Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.

GEORGE: That's amazing.

JERRY: So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.

GEORGE: What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.

JERRY: All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?

ELAINE: I can't. I'm the best man.

JERRY: Kramer, bumper-cars?

KRAMER: I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?

JERRY: Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.

SUBWAY ANNOUNCEMENT: 42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train.

(They all get off and go to different directions.)

ELAINE: See'ya.


[Multiple Subway Train Intro Scenes]

(Jerry comes in and sits down. A fat man across from him gives a look.)

(George gets on another subway train. Sits next to a beautiful woman. They smile to another.)

(Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. Stumbles around as all seats get filled right before him. He squeezes himself into a seat with a young obese man.)

(Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves and Jerry falls in his seat.)


[George's Train]

(Woman next to George rubs her leg and George looks at her)

WOMAN: You looking for a job?

GEORGE: Me, why?

WOMAN: Well, you're reading the classifieds.

GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.

WOMAN: You didn't look like someone who needed a job.

GEORGE: Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.

WOMAN: So, you're in 'the market'?

GEORGE: Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.

WOMAN: Which market?

GEORGE: Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.

WOMAN: So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?

GEORGE: They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.

WOMAN: Really?

GEORGE: Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.

(Train horn blows and George looks back)


[Elaine's Train]

(She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman approaches her)

WOMAN: I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.

ELAINE: It's ironic.

Women: What's ironic?

ELAINE: This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.

WOMAN: No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?

ELAINE: Oh...

WOMAN: Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?

ELAINE: A wedding.

Women: A wedding?

ELAINE: Yeah

WOMAN: Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.

ELAINE: You're telling me.

WOMAN: So, are they a nice couple?

ELAINE: Oh, very nice.

WOMAN: What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?

ELAINE: She.

Women: She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.

ELAINE: There is no he.

Women: There is no he. So, who's getting married?

ELAINE: Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.

Women: Lesbian wedding.

ELAINE: Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.

Women (talks to man next to her): My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)

ELAINE: No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!


[Kramer's train]

(A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat. Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the paper. The other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece of one page.)


[Jerry's train]

(He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to the floor. Man across gives him a look.)


[Elaine's train

(Train is full packed)

ELAINE'S VOICE: I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.

(Train suddenly stops)

ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh, man. We're stopping?


[George's train]

WOMAN: Well, this is where I get off.

GEORGE: Oh, you do?

WOMAN: Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.

GEORGE: No, no, what, what?

WOMAN: Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.

GEORGE: Yeah, well....

WOMAN: Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.

(George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs after her)

GEORGE: Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.

(He gets stuck between closing doors)

GEORGE: I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!


[Kramer's Train]

(Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking)

MAN1: This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick.

MAN2: How do you know it's going to win?

MAN1: My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers. Every horse he has ever given me has won. See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his maiden. It's going to go to great price, maybe 30:1. I'm telling you, it's a lock.

MAN2: But it rained last night.

MAN1: Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'.

MAN2: His mudda' was a mudda'?

MAN1: What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to call my bookie. (looks around to see if anyone is listening) Hey, don't tell anybody.

(Kramer quickly turns away)


[Jerry's Train]

(Jerry wakes up and looks to guy opposite to him. The fat guy is naked and reading a paper.)

JERRY: O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?

NAKED MAN: Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.

JERRY: You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.

NAKED MAN: You got something against naked body?

JERRY: I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?

NAKED MAN: Who's got time for squat thrusts?

JERRY: All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.

NAKED MAN: I like a good breakfast.

JERRY: I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.

NAKED MAN: I'm not ashamed of my body.

JERRY: That's your problem, you should be.

(Naked man drops half of his newspaper)

JERRY: Don't get up, please, allow me.

(Jerry picks up the paper)


[Elaine's Train]

(Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train.)

ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!

(Lights in the train go off)


[George and the woman step in to a hotel room]

GEORGE: Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.

WOMAN: Make your-self comfortable.

(She steps in to bathroom.)

GEORGE'S VOICE: Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.

(She comes out from the bathroom, wearing a nightie.)

GEORGE: Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.


[Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. He is talking with a guy behind in the line.]

KRAMER: Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.

GUY: The bug boy.

KRAMER: Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.

GUY: Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night.

KRAMER: Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.

GUY: His father was a mudda'?

KRAMER: His mudda' was a mudda'.

GUY: His mudda' was a mudda'?

KRAMER: What did I just say?

(Kramer gets to the cashier)

KRAMER: Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.


[Jerry's train]

NAKED MAN: They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.

JERRY: I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.

NAKED MAN: No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence.

JERRY: Defence? Please. ...They need speed.

NAKED MAN: Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen.

JERRY: Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.

NAKED MAN: They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office.

JERRY: But you gotta like their chances.

NAKED MAN: I LUV their chances.

JERRY: Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.

NAKED MAN: It's a deal!


[Elaine is in a stopped train with no lights]

ELAINE'S VOICE: Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!


[George and the beautiful woman are still in the hotel room. The woman is putting handcuffs on George and the other end to the backboard of the bed]

GEORGE: Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.

WOMAN: Oh, don't worry. I do.

(She steps in to the bathroom)

GEORGE: You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.

WOMAN: Like what?

GEORGE: Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"

(She comes out of the bathroom fully clothed)

GEORGE: What's going on?

WOMAN: It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.

GEORGE: Get going? But we haven't really, you know....

WOMAN: Eight dollars? Eight dollars?

GEORGE: What are you doing? You're robbing me?

WOMAN: I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?

GEORGE: Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?

WOMAN: I'm taking your clothes.

GEORGE: No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.

WOMAN: Bye George.

GEORGE: No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?


[Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office]

(The race is on and Pappanick is slowly making ground. Kramer is pounding himself imitating the jockey and shouts: Yes, yes, yes... The winner is Pappanick)

KRAMER: Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)

(Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money around. There is a big thug looking at the money. Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. He makes a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and so does the thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes. The naked man has put his clothes back on and he and Jerry are getting of the train.)

NAKED MAN: I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.

JERRY: First we ride the cyclone.

NAKED MAN: Chilly out.

(Jerry takes a deep breath)

JERRY: Aah, French fries.


[Kramer is running away from the thug and enters the train where the blind violinist is playing. Kramer knocks down the violin player and the thug picks Kramer up and looks for the money.]

THUG: Give me the money. Give me the money!

BLIND VIOLIN PLAYER: (puts a gun to the thug's head) Freeze, Police!


[Back to the Monk's café. Jerry, Kramer and Elaine are sitting in a booth]

JERRY: No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.

ELAINE: Too bad.

JERRY: You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!

(Waves around a stuffed monkey)

JERRY: You want him?

ELAINE: Get that out of my face.

JERRY: So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!

(George enters wearing a sheet)

MAN AT THE COUNTER: (yelling) Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna!

GEORGE: How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?

ELAINE: George?

JERRY: Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?

GEORGE: You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?

JERRY: Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.

GEORGE: Give me your key, I gotta get it.

KRAMER: What happened?

GEORGE: Never mind what happened, just give me the key.

JERRY: Come on, I'll go with you.

ELAINE: Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait...

(Kramer gets the check, looks at it and gets pile of cash and pays. Jerry and Elaine look amazed)

[Jerry's Apartment]

GEORGE: ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!

GEORGE: We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?

(Jerry enters)

JERRY: Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.

GEORGE: I was telling you about Noel.

JERRY: Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...

GEORGE: [sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...

JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. What about her?

GEORGE: What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?

JERRY: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.

GEORGE: No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...

GEORGE: How do I get the hand?

JERRY: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.

GEORGE: She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...

JERRY: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...

GEORGE: Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!

GEORGE: With all due respect, I don't think so...

JERRY: That smells good, what is that?

KRAMER: The *beach*!

JERRY: The *beach*?

GEORGE: What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!

KRAMER: I just joined the Polar Bear Club.

JERRY: You joined the *Polar Bears*?!

GEORGE: What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?

KRAMER: Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....

JERRY: Yeah... So's shock therapy.

JERRY: [with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!

KRAMER: Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.

GEORGE: Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

JERRY: You don't know?

GEORGE: No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...

JERRY: You think they have fleas there, don't you?

GEORGE: *No*...

JERRY: Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.

GEORGE: All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...

ELAINE: I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?

JERRY: They have a piano backstage they warm up on.

ELAINE: *No*, we would have heard it.

JERRY: What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?

GEORGE: I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.

JERRY: [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!

(A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.)

JERRY: Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)

(Noel begins. Dramatically. It's enough to make a man reach for his candy pooper. Jerry helps himself to a Pez, he stands Tweety up on Elaine's purse on her lap. Elaine valiantly tries to hold back her laughter, but it escalates from a giggle to a chortle to a chuckle to laughter to snorting. Noel is visibly shaken and she has difficulty playing with this anonymous distraction from one of the unwashed masses. Elaine removes herself from the auditorium, all the while snorting and gasping for breath, (we're talkin' full-on gales of laughter, here). Outside, she runs into an old acquaintance.)

STEVE: Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.

ELAINE: Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...

STEVE: What're you doing down here?

ELAINE: Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.

MOLLIKA: Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.

ELAINE: We did. We're just hanging out.

MOLLIKA: REally. ... You really look great.

ELAINE: Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?

MOLLIKA: Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.

ELAINE: Have you thought about an intervention?

MOLLIKA: What's that?

ELAINE: You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.

MOLLIKA: He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.

(Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.)


[Outside Noel's dressing room]

ElainELAINE: I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!

GEORGE: What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?

JERRY: I dunno, it was an impulse.

GEORGE: What kind of a sick impulse does that??

JERRY: How could I know she would start to laugh?

ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!

JERRY: Can we just go in already?

GEORGE: What are we gonna tell her?

ELAINE: I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.

GEORGE: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...

ELAINE: [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.

JERRY: What about?

GEORGE: Hey, hey! We're discussing something!

JERRY: I know, but I'm distracted now.

GEORGE: What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.

ELAINE: When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.

JERRY: Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?

ELAINE: He's good.

GEORGE: Uh, can we cut to the chase?

JERRY: "Cut to the chase"?

GEORGE: Yeah...

JERRY: What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?

GEORGE: A lot of people say it.

JERRY: I would lose that.

GEORGE: [Accusingly] What's *that*?

JERRY: "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!

GEORGE: [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.

ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.

JERRY: Really, an intervention ...

GEORGE: Y'know people, we got a situation over here!

ELAINE: Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.

JERRY: Me? Why me?

ELAINE: 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.

JERRY: Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...

GEORGE: All right, OK, I'm goin' in.

JERRY: We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)

ELAINE: All right.

(They Enter)

GEORGE: Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.

NOEL: No..

GEORGE: Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel

JERRY: You play a *Hell* of a piano.

ELAINE: Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.

NOEL: Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...

ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.

NOEL: Well then, what was she laughing at?

JERRY: Pez?

NOEL: Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?

GEORGE: Me, uh, uh, no, ...

JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.

ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.

JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.

NOEL: I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]

ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.

GEORGE: If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)

[Noel enters]

GEORGE: All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.

NOEL: I don't feel like it tonight.

JERRY: We'll be outside

ELAINE: Yeah

JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?

NOEL: I just crack my knuckles.

GEORGE: We'll have a good time

NOEL: I don't feel like it

GEORGE: Ah, come on

NOEL: I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!

GEORGE: Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]


[MONKS]

JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.

ELAINE: What? How?

JERRY: A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.

ELAINE: So? What happened?

JERRY: What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.

ELAINE: Shut up!

JERRY: All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.

ELAINE: Whar about Kramer?

JERRY: He's the same!


[Jerry on phone at home]

JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?

KRAMER: (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.

KRAMER: Can I get in on that?

JERRY: What do you think? It's like a poker game?

KRAMER: Is Elaine going?

JERRY: Yeah

KRAMER: Well, I knew him as well as she did.

JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her.

KRAMER: So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?

JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.

(Buzzer)

GEORGE: It's George

JERRY: Stop smelling your arm.

KRAMER: You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach

JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."

KRAMER: Tell me about it!

JERRY: Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Well it's over. It's definitely over.

JERRY: She broke up with you?

GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.

JERRY: What was on the list?

GEORGE: Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,

JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,

GEORGE: Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.

JERRY: What's wrong with lunch?

GEORGE: Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.

KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?

GEORGE: I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.

KRAMER: Break up with her

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.

JERRY: A preemptive breakup.

GEORGE: A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.


[MONKS]

GEORGE: So, I am have to going to break up with you.

NOEL: You're breaking up with me?

GEORGE: I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.

NOEL: Wow.

GEORGE: Shocked?

NOEL: I really am.

GEORGE: Never expected this did you?

NOEL: I thought everything was fine.

GEORGE: Well, live and learn.

NOEL: I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?

GEORGE: Kind of.

NOEL: I'm very confused.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.

NOEL: I thought,...

GEORGE: Now, stop it ...

NOEL: What do you want, I can make you happy.

GEORGE: When you're playing the piano do you think about me?

NOEL: I don't know.

GEORGE: This is what I'm talking about.

NOEL: OK, I'll think about you.

GEORGE: All the time.

NOEL: All the time? ... OK, All the time.

GEORGE: I can't hear you.

NOEL: All the time. ALL THE TIME.

GEORGE: See, It's not so hard.


[CALVIN KLEIN]

KRAMER: Go ahead smell, smell

STEVE: Yeah, so?

KRAMER: Do you recognize it? ... The beach.

STEVE: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm talking about the beach.

STEVE: What about it?

KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.

STEVE: That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.

KRAMER: Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?

STEVE: Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.

KRAMER: So you don't think it's a good idea?


[The Intervention [NOTE:DOUBLE CHECK THIS PART FOR SURE!!!!]

(To Elaine)

GUY: The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there

ELAINE: (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?

GUY: Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.

(To Jerry)

OTHER GUY: Are there any ice cubes?

JERRY: In the freezer.

OTHER GUY: I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.

JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.

OTHER GUY: I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)

GUY: Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?

STEVE: What's the plan?

JERRY: Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.

OTHER GUY: Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.

GUY: No, we all have to talk.

ELAINE: What's the order?

GUY: We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.

ROBERTA: Why am I first?

ELAINE: Albano is your last name.

ROBERTA: That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.

STEVE: I'll go first.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Is this the interference?

JERRY: Intervention.

OTHER GUY: What are you doing here?

KRAMER: Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?

STEVE: Hey, this is for close friends only.

KRAMER: I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?

OTHER GUY: Let him stay.

KRAMER: Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.

STEVE: Somebody's going to make that crap?

(Some old guys enter)

OLD GUY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.

OTHER GUY: They can't stay.

OLD GUY: We're having a party here?

JERRY: No, we're having an intervention

OLD GUY: An intervention? Who's intervening?

JERRY: There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.

OLD GUY: Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, "What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?"

(Buzzer)

GUY: It's him.

ROBERTA: What should we do?

ELAINE: Hide!

JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)

GEORGE: It's George

JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.

GUY: If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.

ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.

GUY: Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?

ELAINE: You're getting warm.

(George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful)

GEORGE: We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.

JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.

GEORGE: Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?

JERRY: Well, uh..

NOEL: (happily) Elaine, hi.

ELAINE: Oh, hi Noel

(Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them)

JERRY: Well, you're looking well.

GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.

STEVE: Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

GEORGE: (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!

STEVE: You think so?

GEORGE: I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you

OLD MAN: The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.

ELAINE: (Chuckles)

Old GUY; at least give me a pocket.

ELAINE: (laughs)

(Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven)

NOEL: That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.

ELAINE: No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.

(Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg)

NOEL: You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.

JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.

NOEL: You lied to me George, you lied to me.

GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?

NOEL: I ... am breaking up ... with you!

GEORGE: You can't break up with me. I've got hand.

NOEL: And you're going to need it.

(Noel exits, George chases her)

(Richie and John enter)

JERRY: Hey Richie

RICHIE: So what's going on?

(Later)

JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.

GEORGE: I can't do these puzzles.

JERRY: So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table

GEORGE: Ah ah Pez dispenser.

JERRY: He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them

GEORGE: Well they're hard to load.

JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.

GEORGE: Poor kid.

JERRY: So as he's telling the story he starts crying.

GEORGE: What did you do?

JERRY: What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.

GEORGE: Wow

JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.

GEORGE: What's a three letter word for candy?

JERRY: I can't do those things.

The thing I don’t understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don’t die and that’s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don’t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it’s worse because now they’ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that’s why these people don’t succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don’t work, try a rope. Car won’t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There’s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.



[Jerry’s Apartment]

JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?

ELAINE: Na.

JERRY: What are you doing? We’re going out for dinner in ten minutes.

ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: It’s George.

JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You’ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?

ELAINE: I don’t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?

JERRY: I think I’ll take out the garbage.

ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?

JERRY: Well, once I didn’t have dinner until, like 9:00 o’clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage – meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya’? Throw out my garbage for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Come on, it’s just down the hall.

GEORGE: Give me two bucks. I’ll do it for two bucks.

JERRY: I’ll give you 50 cents.

GEORGE: There’s no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.

JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake’s coffee cake

GEORGE: You’re not getting no Drake’s Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I’m all set. I got the ticket. I’m going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.

JERRY: I don’t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?

GEORGE: It’s an incredible deal. I don’t know why you don’t come with me.

JERRY: Nah, I don’t go for these non-refundable deals. I can’t commit to a woman. I’m not going to commit to an airline.

(Gina enters the hall)

GINA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

GINA: How are you?

JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake’s Coffee Cake is?

GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.

JERRY: How much do they cost?

GINA: The junior?

GEORGE: No, no the full size.

JERRY: No, no the junior.

GEORGE: You didn’t say "junior".

GINA: I haven’t had one of those since I was a little girl.

JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya’ doing?

MARTIN: Good enough.

(MARTIN leaves with Gina)

JERRY: Boy she’s sexy isn’t she?

(Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer’s apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry’s apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)

JERRY: Do you believe that guy?

ELAINE: What guy?

JERRY: My neighbour:

ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?

JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?

GEORGE: He didn’t seem too pleased.

ELAINE: Maybe I’ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.

GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.

JERRY: What’s so amazing? You’ve seen him before.

GEORGE: I haven’t seen him for months.

JERRY: What was the dream?

GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.

JERRY: I think I’ve played there.

GEORGE: I’ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.

JERRY: You’re a little paranormal

ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.

GEORGE: I’d love to go. Make an appointment.

JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?

GEORGE: I just got fired.

JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.

ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.

JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.

(They exit)



[Jerry’s apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]

JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?

GINA: It’s Gina.

JERRY: Who?

GINA: Martine’s girl friend.

JERRY: Martine?

GINA: You next door neighbour.

JERRY: Oh, Martin!

(Jerry opens door)

GEORGE: It’s Martine. I think he’s dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.

JERRY: What?

GINA: Come on.

JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.

GINA: We don’t have enough time.

JERRY: It’ll take two seconds.

GINA: There is no time.

JERRY: We don’t have two seconds?

GINA: All right. Go ahead.

JERRY: Nah, forget it.

GINA: No, go ahead.

JERRY: Nah. I’ll just wear the pajamas.

GINA: Will you just get it.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GINA: Forget it. Come on.

JERRY: Nah, I’ll go get the robe.



[Metropolitan Hospital Center]

JERRY: That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.

GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.

JERRY: Really? It’s over?

GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man’s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.

JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?

GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake’s Coffee Cake.

JERRY: He said that?

GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How it’s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.

JERRY: I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.

GINA: I wasn’t.

JERRY: You weren’t?

GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?

JERRY: Of course.

GINA: Tell me everything.

JERRY: Are you sure he can’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.

GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.

JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.

GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.

JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.

GINA: Are you afraid of him?

JERRY: No.

GINA: Then kiss me.

JERRY: Here?

GINA: Yes, right here.

JERRY: Is this the proper venue?

GINA: You don’t want to?

JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.

GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.

JERRY: I can’t. What if he wakes up?

GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and you’re afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?

JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.



[Jerry’s apartment]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?

JERRY: Yeah, I heard.

KRAMER: I can’t believe he’s in a coma.

KRAMER: He’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?

JERRY: Who told you about Martin?

KRAMER: Newman! He’s good friends with him.

JERR: Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.

KRAMER: He’s got all of my attachments, you know.

JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?

KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?

JERRY: You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? They can’t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?

KRAMER: So what’s going on between you and Gina?

JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.

KRAMER: Uh, uh.

JERRY: So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.

KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see that’s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?

JERRY: Nothing.

KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?

JERRY: I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.

KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see that’s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn’t matter what you do around it.

JERRY: So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.

KRAMER: I’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can’t get out of it in 24 hours, it’s a land rush.

JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?

KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! That’s why I’m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody’s going to grab it.



[The psychic’s apartment]

RULA: Martin’s spirit came to you as a warning.

ELAINE: Why would he come to George?

RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.

GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.

RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?

GEORGE: Drakes?

RULA: Yes.

GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?

RULA: No, why?

GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drake’s Coffee Cake.

RULA: Maybe I did.

ELAINE: Take it away.

GEORGE: She hasn’t eaten in two days.

RULA: Who’s Pauline?

GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.

RULA: Do you think about her?

GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.

RULA: Cut these with your left hand.

GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.

RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?

RULA: Not in this life.

ELAINE: Should you be smoking?

RULA: Does it bother you?

ELAINE: You’re pregnant.

GEORGE: Elaine.

RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.

RULA: Ah oh.

GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?

RULA: I don’t know about this trip George.

GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?

ELAINE: It’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.

GEORGE: Elaine, she’s a psychic. She knows how the kid’s going to be.

GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?

RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.

ELAINE: Now listen. I just don’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.

GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?

ELAINE: It’s disgusting.

RULA: I DON’T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.

ELAINE: Oh fine, I don’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.

RULA: Get the hell out.

(Elaine leaving)

GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.

GEORGE: If you don’t say anything I will assume it’s a plane crash.

RULA: Get out.

GEORGE: Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?



[Jerry’s apartment]

GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.

JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.

GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.

GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?

JERRY: They’re a comedy team.

GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.

JERRY: Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.

GINA: You will show me The Stooges?

JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.

GINA: When?

JERRY: Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.

GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.

JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.

GINA: You’re still afraid. You are not a man.

JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?

GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?

JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.

(Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman)

KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.

NEWMAN: I can’t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.

KRAMER: ???

NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Hello Newman.



[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]

JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.

GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn’t hurt me.

ELAINE: (jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?

JERRY: Boy, it’s a good thing we came.

GEORGE: Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there’s native unrest.

ELAINE: Hi, I haven’t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.

NURSE: We’ll call you.

JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If I’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.

GEORGE: How come?

JERRY: Looters.

ELAINE: How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?

JERRY: She’s really hungry.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: Kramer

KRAMER: Well, Newman’s upstairs visiting Martin.

GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?

KRAMER: You’re not going?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Why not?

GEORGE: The psychic said something terrible will happen.

KRAMER: I dig.



[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martin’s room]

KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she’s going to kill me.

NEWMAN: He can’t hear you, you idiot. Why don’t you just buy another one.

KRAMER: Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?

NEWMAN: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.

KRAMER: I don’t want a carpet sweeper. They don’t do anything.

NEWMAN: It gets my rug clean.

KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.

NEWMAN: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.

KRAMER: I wouldn’t set foot in your house.

(Jerry enters)

JERRY: Hello.

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: How’s he doing?

KRAMER: He looks happy to me.

NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.

JERRY: Why wouldn’t he?

NEWMAN: No reason.

JERRY: He’ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.

NEWMAN: I’ll bring him up to date.

JERRY: How up to date?

NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.

JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?

NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.

KRAMER: Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He’s not going.

NEWMAN: I don’t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..

JERRY: Drake’s Coffee Cake

NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?

JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.

NEWMAN: Boy, that’s the full size.

JERRY: That’s your big boy.

NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?

JERRY: I don’t give out bites. I got another one. But I’m saving it for later.

NEWMAN: Just one bite?

JERRY: I don’t think so. You know they, they’re so fragile.

NEWMAN: All right! All right. I won’t say anything.

JERRY: You swear?

NEWMAN: I swear.

JERRY: On your mother’s life?

NEWMAN: On my mother’s life.

KRAMER: oh oh oh oh oh

NEWMAN: Oooh,



[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]

ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.

(George sees the Psychic’s girl, Faisy and follows her into the Psychic’s room))

GEORGE: …sweetheart, no come here, … sweetheart

RULA: pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)

GEORGE: how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.

RULA: The nurse said she would be right back. They’re supposed to take me into the delivery room.

GEORGE: Oh, that’s great. That’s great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don’t even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn’t get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..

RULA: Oh, where’s the nurse

GEORGE: I don’t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don’t you get a nurse for mommy? … Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.

RULA: Don’t take that trip.

GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?

RULA: (screams) EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.

(Doctor enters)

Dx: All right, Rula, it’s time to go.

GEORGE: Because? Because?

(Elaine enters Martins room)

ELAINE: Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! … Drake’s Coffee Cake? … Give me that.

NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or I’ll tell.

JERRY: Elaine! No! No!

MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,

(In hallway as they wheel Rula to give birth)

GEORGE: Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

(Martin’s room – Martin grabbing Jerry – Elaine eating the Drake’s Coffee Cake)

NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.

KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!

JERRY: Hey!

NEWMAN: It was disgusting.



[Jerry’s apartment]

JERRY: What are you doing? We’re going out to dinner in ten minutes.

GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. It’s really quite disgusting.

JERRY: What did she name the kid?

GEORGE: You wouldn’t believe it. Rasputin.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Heey!

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: when did you get back?

KRAMER: A couple of hours ago.

GEORGE: So how was it?

KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.

JERRY: osh.

KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.

JERRY: Woah. (hitting George)

KRAMER: Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.

JERRY: Wow! (hitting George)

KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson

JERRY: Oh! (hitting George)

KRAMER: We played Backgammon in the nude.

JERRY: Oh! (hitting George)

KRAMER: She’s a sweet kid.

JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!

KRAMER: Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That’s probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.

GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta’ watch for the jellyfish.

KRAMER: Yeah.

KRAMER: What’s this?

JERRY: Oh, it’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.

KRAMER: They moved in together?

JERRY: Yeah, it’s some place down in the village.

KRAMER: Phew.

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: It’s Elaine.

JERRY: All right we’re coming down.

KRAMER: Hey, where ya’ going?

JERRY: We’re taking Elaine to dinner. She’s got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?

KRAMER: Um, I’d like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we’ll be getting together.

GEORGE: Elle McPherson going to be there?

KRAMER: OH! I got to call her back.

(Kramer exits)

Well have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time and a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now you are playing God. Of course God was the first person to fix people up. Fixed up Adam and Eve. Ya know I'm sure he said to Adam, "No she's nice ah..she's a..she's a.. yeah she's very free about here body doesn't really wear much and ah she was going out with a snake. I think that's over though."


[Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.]

GEORGE: Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.

JERRY: Oh, yes you will.

GEORGE: No, I won't.

JERRY: Yeah, maybe you won't.

GEORGE: I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.

JERRY: Are my nostrils getting bigger?

GEORGE: No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm

George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?

(Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi' which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)


[Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.]

CYNTHIA: There's just no men out there, you know?

ELAINE: I know.

CYNTHIA: I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.

ELAINE: I hate the good ones.

CYNTHIA: Is Jerry one of the good ones?

ELAINE: That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.

CYNTHIA: Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're right."

ELAINE: You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.

CYNTHIA: No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.


[Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.]

GEORGE: I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.

JERRY: Oh, so there's still hope.

GEORGE: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.

JERRY: Oh, so hopelessness is the key.

GEORGE: It's my only hope.


[Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.]

CYNTHIA: See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.

ELAINE: Well, at least you're not bitter.

CYNTHIA: Who says I'm not bitter?

ELAINE: Aren't you too young to be bitter?

CYNTHIA: No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.

ELAINE: Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.

CYNTHIA: Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.


[Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.

ELAINE: So what'd you do last night?

JERRY: Went out with George, you?

ELAINE: Went out with Cynthia.

JERRY: How was it? What'd you talk about?

ELAINE: Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?

JERRY: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.

ELAINE: I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.

JERRY: George too.

(They look at each other for a moment.)

JERRY AND ELAINE (together): Yeah, right.

JERRY: I've never fixed anybody up.

ELAINE: Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.

JERRY: Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?

ELAINE: I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?

JERRY: Well you implied it.

ELAINE: I didn't say it.

JERRY: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?

ELAINE: Who is he?

JERRY: He's George!

ELAINE: She's Cynthia!

JERRY: So what?

ELAINE: What, you don't think she's beautiful?

JERRY: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?

ELAINE: You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.

JERRY: I went out with you.

ELAINE: That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.

JERRY: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.

ELAINE: He can really do that?

JERRY: Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.

ELAINE: What, are you into this?

JERRY: Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

ELAINE: No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?

JERRY: Naturally.

ELAINE: Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?

JERRY: Everything.

ELAINE: What if it worked out?

JERRY (dialing): Yeah right.


[Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.]

GEORGE: Out of the question. Out of the question!

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?

JERRY: She's good looking.

GEORGE: How good looking?

JERRY: Very good looking.

GEORGE: Really good looking?

JERRY: Really very good looking.

GEORGE: Would you take her out?

JERRY: Yes, I would take her out.

GEORGE: Oh, you hesitated.

JERRY: What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!

GEORGE: No, something's off here, you hesitated.

JERRY: I'm telling you, she's good looking.

GEORGE: What about the body, what kind of body?

JERRY: Good body, nice body.

GEORGE: How nice?

JERRY: Nice.

GEORGE: Just nice?

JERRY: Pretty nice.

GEORGE: Really good?

JERRY: Really very nice and good.

GEORGE: What about personality?

JERRY: Good personality. Funny. Bright.

GEORGE: Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.

JERRY: How could she be smarter than you?

GEORGE: Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?


[Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.]

CYNTHIA: First of all, what does he do?

ELAINE: He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-

CYNTHIA: He's not working?! How come he's not working?

ELAINE: Well, um, he, he got fired.

CYNTHIA: Why did he get fired?

ELAINE: Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.

CYNTHIA: Excuse me?

ELAINE: Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.

CYNTHIA: Is he nuts?

ELAINE: No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.

CYNTHIA: What does he look like?

ELAINE: Pardon?

CYNTHIA: What does he look like?

ELAINE: Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.

CYNTHIA: Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?

ELAINE: Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.

CYNTHIA: He's bald?

ELAINE: No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.

CYNTHIA: So he will be bald.

ELAINE: Yup.


[Cut back to Jerry and George.]

GEORGE: What kind of hair?

JERRY: You know, long dark hair.

GEORGE: Flowing?

JERRY: Flowing?

GEORGE: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.

JERRY: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?

GEORGE: Yeah, that's right.

JERRY: Just clarifying.

GEORGE: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?

JERRY: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?

GEORGE: I'd like to be able to get it out.

JERRY: I think you'll get it out.

GEORGE: What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.

JERRY: She's got a fine cheek.

GEORGE: Is there a pinkish hue?

JERRY: A pinkish hue?

GEORGE: Yes, a rosy glow.

JERRY: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.

GEORGE: Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.

JERRY: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.


[Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia]

CYNTHIA: Has he ever been married?

ELAINE: No.

CYNTHIA: Has he been close?

ELAINE: He once spent a weekend with a woman.

CYNTHIA: He didn't really try to poison his boss?

ELAINE: Yeah, he did.


[The next day, George is back at Jerry's]

GEORGE: We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?

JERRY: I think it's tamber.

GEORGE: Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?

JERRY: I didn't notice the voice.

GEORGE: It's mellifluous!

JERRY: So, Saturday night.

GEORGE: She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.

(Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Hey! Saturday night!

ELAINE: I know!

GEORGE: So, what did she say?

ELAINE: She said you're getting together Saturday night!

GEORGE: That's it?

ELAINE: Yeah!

GEORGE: She didn't mention anything about the conversation?

ELAINE: No.

GEORGE: Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: She could have mentioned the conversation.

GEORGE: Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?

JERRY: Oh, the guy from Jersey?

KRAMER: Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.

GEORGE: What are you gonna do with all of them?

KRAMER: Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.

JERRY: No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.

KRAMER: Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.

ELAINE: Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

GEORGE: I'll take one. It's possible.


[Mid-episode monologue]

The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" (nods) "Have a nice day." "You too."


[Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.]

JERRY: So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?

ELAINE: I think they went out to dinner.

JERRY: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?

GEORGE: Yeah, it's me, I just got home.

JERRY: Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.

JERRY: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.

ELAINE: Remember our pact. Full disclosure.

JERRY: Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.

GEORGE: Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.

JERRY: You can tell me, I'll vault it.

GEORGE: It's in the vault?

JERRY: I'm locking the vault. What?

GEORGE: We had sex.

JERRY: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?

GEORGE: I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.

JERRY: At your apartment?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: She didn't stay over?

GEORGE: No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.

[Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.]

ELAINE: Oh my god.

CYNTHIA: He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.

ELAINE: So? How was it?

CYNTHIA: How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.

ELAINE: Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.

CYNTHIA: Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.

ELAINE: Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?

JERRY: So, what did she have to say?

ELAINE: What did he have to say?

JERRY: He said they had a good time.

ELAINE: Her too.

JERRY: Oh, good.

ELAINE: Anything else?

JERRY: Nope. You?

ELAINE: Nope.

JERRY: You sure?

ELAINE: Yup. You?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.

JERRY: Yeah. Okay then.

ELAINE: Alright. Goodnight.

JERRY: Goodnight.


[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.

JERRY: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.

GEORGE: What are you gonna do?

JERRY: Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.

GEORGE: I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.

JERRY: I'm gonna call her.

GEORGE: No, don't call her.

JERRY: No, I'm calling her.

GEORGE: No, Jerry, don't call.

JERRY: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.

GEORGE: I don't want you to call.

JERRY: Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.

GEORGE: Give me the phone!

JERRY: George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?

GEORGE: Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!

Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.

KRAMER: Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!

JERRY: I'll just call her when you leave!

GEORGE: You can't do that, it's none of your business!

JERRY: It is so my business!

KRAMER: Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!

GEORGE: But tell him to give me the--

KRAMER: Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Yeah, but--

KRAMER: Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.

JERRY: But Kramer--

KRAMER: Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.

(Jerry and George shake hands)

KRAMER: Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: Right.

GEORGE: Defective?!

KRAMER: Defective.

GEORGE: (attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!

KRAMER: I didn't even know they were defective.

(Jerry gets between them to break up the fight)

KRAMER: Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.

GEORGE: What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!

JERRY: Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!


[Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia]

CYNTHIA: I missed my period.

ELAINE: Oh my god.

CYNTHIA: I am very worried, I am never late.

ELAINE: But he used a condom, right?

CYNTHIA: I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.

ELAINE: Oh no.

CYNTHIA: What?

ELAINE: Was it blue?

CYNTHIA: Yeah. How'd you know?

ELAINE: Just a hunch.


[Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.]

JERRY: Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!

(Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.)

JERRY: Oh, hi. Soda?

ELAINE: No thanks.

JERRY: So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

ELAINE: Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.

JERRY: Oh, I know her. I know her type.

ELAINE: Her type? What type?

JERRY: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!

ELAINE: You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!

JERRY: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.

ELAINE: She's not bitter!

JERRY: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!

ELAINE: Twisted? God, I did you a favor.

JERRY: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?

ELAINE: Are you calling me a liar?

JERRY: I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?

ELAINE: Are you?

JERRY: Get your finger out of my face.

ELAINE: You get yours out, I was here first!

JERRY: I don't care.

ELAINE: Get it out!

(Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets in the middle.)

KRAMER: Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.

ELAINE: I knew those condoms were defective!

JERRY: How did you know they were defective?!

(George walks in.)

ELAINE: Because! Because she missed her period!

GEORGE: She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!

(George rushes out, hysterical.)


[Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant]

CYNTHIA: So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.

ELAINE: Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.

CYNTHIA: I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period." And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--

(George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.)

ELAINE: Hi!

GEORGE: Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.

ELAINE: What happened?

JERRY: Acting.

ELAINE: Very mature.

JERRY: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.

CYNTHIA: Hi.

JERRY: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.

CYNTHIA: Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.

GEORGE: (hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.

JERRY: So what are these?

ELAINE: Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.

(George starts eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the idea that the relationship has just ended.)

GEORGE: (with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.


[Closing monologue]

Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed up Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. She's very free about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with a snake, I think that's over though."

To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.


[Gym Locker Room]

KRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.

GEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.

JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.

GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.

JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.

GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!

JERRY: You chuck.

GEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?

KRAMER: You're a chucker.

GEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?

JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.

KRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.

JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.

KRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?

JERRY: No, did you?

KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?

GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.

JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.

KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.

JERRY: All right

KRAMER: Have a good one.

JERRY: All right

GEORGE: See ya.

(Kramer exits)

GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?

JERRY: You know who that is? That's

GEORGE: Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?

JERRY: Yeah, that's him.

GEORGE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Positive.

GEORGE: Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.

JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.

GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff

JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.

GEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension

JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?

GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.

JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.

GEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.

JERRY: So?

GEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!

JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.

GEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.

KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

JERRY: Really?

KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do.

JERRY: What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time

GEORGE: Mine too.

KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson

JERRY: Thank you.

GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...

KEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?

JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.

GEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.

JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.

KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee

JERRY: Oh. that would be great.

GEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.

KEITH: Who's this chucker?


[Monks]

JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.

ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.

JERRY: I can't ... I can't

ELAINE: Why not?

JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.

ELAINE: What's the difference?

JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.

ELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.

JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?

ELAINE: I'm sorry honey.

JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.

ELAINE: No,

JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.

ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.

JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!

ELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?

JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?

ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?

JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?

ELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.

JERRY: For what dinner?

ELAINE: Dinner's good.

JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?

ELAINE: Jerry, He's A GUY!

JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.


[Middle Monologue]

When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food. They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend, they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!


[New York State Department of Labor]

MRS. SOKOL: You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.

GEORGE: Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.

MRS. SOKOL: So where have you been looking for work?

GEORGE: Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.

MRS. SOKOL: Can you be specific about any of these companies?

GEORGE: Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..

MRS. SOKOL: Well just give me one name.

GEORGE: Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.

MRS. SOKOL: And what type of company is that?

GEORGE: Latex, latex manufacturing

MRS. SOKOL: And you interviewed there?

GEORGE: Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.

MRS. SOKOL: I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this uh, Vandelay company...

GOERGE: You like gum? 'Cause I have a friend in the gum business. I got a gum guy. I make one phone call. I got boxes of delivered right to your door.

GEORGE: Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.

(George runs down hall)


[Street phone booth- George pulls kid out of booth]

GEORGE: (Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.


[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: (loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?

JERRY: Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?

ELAINE: Jerry, ... He's a GUY!

KRAMER: well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.

KRAMER: ... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.


[Phone Booth]

GEORGE: hitting phone


[Cop bangs on booth with kid beside him]

(George looks at him)


[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER: Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.

JERRY: Oh, see the baby again with the baby..

ELAINE: Who are they?

JERRY: Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.

JERRY: (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?

ELAINE: You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.

JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.

ELAINE: yeah ha ha ha

JERRY: Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?

KRAMER: (does a double take) It's too busy

ELAINE: It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.

KRAMER: What guy?

JERRY: I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.

KRAMER: Who are you talkin about?

JERRY: Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.

KRAMER: KEITH HERNANDEZ?

NEWMAN: (enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?


[In cab]

GEORGE: Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.

(changes lanes)

GEORGE: You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -

CABBY: That's it GET OUT!!

GEORGE: Get out?

CABBY: Get out of my cab.

GEORGE: Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab

(Cabby gets out)

GEORGE: No, no! You can't throw me out

(Wrestling in cab)


[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: Hellooo Newman.

KRAMER: I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.

NEWMAN: I despise him.

ELAINE: Why?

NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...

KRAMER: Let me tell it ..

NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..

KRAMER: You always tell it ..

NEWMAN: All right, tell it.

KRAMER: Ja ja ja - just tell it

NEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.

NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.

ELAINE: What was it?

KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.

ELAINE: Wow! What a story.

JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.

JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.

[THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM; SCENE IN
THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!]

NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.

JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?

KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left

JERRY: Again

KRAMER: Back and to the left

JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left

ELAINE: So, what are you saying?

JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

ELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.

JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.

NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)

KRAMER: Wait, wait, (Exits)

JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.

(George runs in)

GEORGE: (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?

JERRY: No. What happened to you?

GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".

JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And what is that?

GEORGE: You're in latex

JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?

GEORGE: Ya manufacture it.

ELAINE: Here in this little apartment?

JERRY: And what do I say about you?

GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.

JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?

GEORGE: Because I asked you to.

JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.

(Buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: It's Keith.

JERRY: All right we're coming down.

GEORGE: KEITH HERNANDEZ:?

JERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.

GEORGE: Where are you goin?

ELAINE: He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?

JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.

GEORGE: What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)


[Keith's car]

JERRY: Well that was really fun, thanks.

KEITH: Yeah, it really was.

JERRY: (smiling) Yeah

GEORGE: What kind of a shake does he have?

JERRY: Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.

GEORGE: So, uh, you gonna see him again?

JERRY: He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.

GEORGE: Wow! The weekend.

JERRY: So then as I was getting out of the car, ...

ELAINE: And you feel you're not really ready for,…

JERRY: Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?


[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: What's going on?

JERRY: Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.

KRAMER: What? Well, you hardly know the guy…. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?

JERRY: … I said yes.

KRAMER: YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?

JERRY: I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..

KRAMER: yeah yeah

JERRY: hey Kramer do me a favour .

[Fitzpatrick's Bar]

KRAMER: Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.

ELAINE: (chuckles)

KRAMER: I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.

ELAINE: Ha, I didn't mention it.

KRAMER: Well I won them anyway.

ELAINE: Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.

KRAMER: Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.

ELAINE: ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.

KRAMER: The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.

ELAINE: Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?

KRAMER: Funny.

JERRY: She likes him I mean she really likes him.

GEORGE: How do you kn ow?

JERRY: Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.

GEORGE: I suppose he's an attractive man, I , …

JERRY: Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.

GEORGE: Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?

JERRY: You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.

GEORGE: You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?

JERRY: I don't know … six three.

GEORGE: Wow, … god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.

JERRY: So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.

GEORGE: Magellan? You like Magellan?

JERRY: Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.

GEORGE: Who do you like?

GEORGE: I like DeSoto.

JERRY: DeSoto? What did he do?

GEORGE: Discovered the Mississippi.

JERRY: Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.

GEORGE: All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?

JERRY: No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.

GEORGE: What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.

JERRY: I know isn't that something?

KRAMER: He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

JERRY: I don't know … he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.

GEORGE: The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..

JERRY: I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!


[New York State Department of lab or]

GEORGE: I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.

MRS. SOKOL: Sign here please.

GEORGE: Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.

MRS. SOKOL: All right just sign it. People are waiting.

GEORGE: You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]

MRS. SOKOL: That was autographed by the '86 Mets. I saw every inning that year.

GEORGE: Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.

MRS. SOKOL: You know Keith Hernandez.

GEORGE: Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?

MRS. SOKOL: Oh, come on. Come on.

GEORGE: I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.

MRS. SOKOL: All right. You got ONE hour.

GEORGE: All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.

(George slowly leave the office then takes off down the hallway)


[Same phone booth as part one]

(George sees large construction worker in booth and leaves. he hops into a cab)

GEORGE: 129 west 81st street and hurry.

(same cabby as part one; stares at him)

GEORGE: Goodbye (exits cab)


[Jerry's Apartment]

KEITH: Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.

JERRY: Is there a box spring?

KEITH: What's that?

JERRY: Is there a box spring?

KEITH: Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.

JERRY: Is that a sectional?

KEITH: Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> …coffee table.

JERRY: Is that a thick marble?


[… Jerry and Keith start to laugh and Jerry walks behind Keith so they don't make eye
contact and break up]

KEITH: Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.

JERRY: STAIRS??? There's no elevator?

KEITH: Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

JERRY: I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.

(Kramer enters, sees Keith and does a double take)

KRAMER: Hello.

KEITH: Hello.

KRAMER: Oh, you don't remember me.

KEITH: No should I [continuity error: in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]

KRAMER: Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.

(Newman enters)

NEWMAN: June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.

KEITH: YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."

KRAMER: Ah, you remember.

NEWMAN: And then you spit on us.

KEITH: Hey, I didn't spit at you.

NEWMAN: Oh, yeah, right.

KRAMER: No no no, well, then who was it?

KEITH: Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. … Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.

JERRY: I told you!

NEWMAN: Wow, it was McDowell.

JERRY: But why? Why McDowell?

KRAMER: Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.

NEWMAN: He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.

NEWMAN: It was McDowell.

KRAMER: Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.

NEWMAN: Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.

KEITH: look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.

KRAMER: Wait, uh what are ya' doing?

KEITH: I gotta move.

KRAMER: Want any help?

KEITH: I'd love some.

KRAMER: I'd love to help you move.

NEWMAN: Me too.

KEITH: Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.

KRAMER: No sweat.

(Kramer and Newman exit)

(phone rings)

JERRY: Hello, … oh hi Elaine .. what's going on … no he just left … you broke up with him? … ME TOO .. what happened? … oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope … me … nah … I couldn't go through with it … I just didn't feel ready … so what are you doing now? … Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.

(George frantically enters)

GEORGE: Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?

JERRY: You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?

GEORGE: (out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend … the guy from the locker room, … I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.

(sits down)

JERRY: Well Biff/ What's next?

GEORGE: I don't know.

(Tall girl enters)

TALL GIRL: Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.


[Ending Monologue]

When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about is boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the street going in and out of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean it's all you think about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. Shut up I'm looking for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it you can smell them. You walk into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Dammit, I can SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard in the morning. You could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and your looking at the casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice handles on it. And that's what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask to help you with a big move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've been waiting for your whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.

Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.


[George is at the airport]

GEORGE: It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?

(The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the other side.)

GEORGE: Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?

MAN: There's a clock over there.

GEORGE: Where?

MAN: (pointing) There.

GEORGE: But you have a watch on.

MAN: It's right by the escalator.

GEORGE: Why don't you just look at your watch?

MAN: I told you, it's right over there.

GEORGE: Let me see the watch.

(George grabs the man's wrist.)

MAN: Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!

GEORGE: You know we're living in a society!

(Jerry walks up from the ramp.)

JERRY: George.

GEORGE: Jerry. Jerry.

JERRY: Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?

GEORGE: I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.

JERRY: Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.

GEORGE: One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.

JERRY: So you have no car?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: So what good are you?

Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says O'BRIEN

JERRY: I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.

GEORGE: How do you know?

JERRY: He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.

GEORGE: We should take his limo.

JERRY: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.

JERRY: He's definitely in Chicago.

GEORGE: Well the guy's just standing there.

JERRY: How would we do it?

GEORGE: We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."

JERRY: Maybe he knows O'Brien?

GEORGE: No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.

JERRY: What if we get caught?

GEORGE: What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.

JERRY: Who's gonna be O'Brien?

GEORGE: I'll be O'Brien.

JERRY: Who am I?

GEORGE: You're you.

JERRY: Just me?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Okay.

GEORGE: What, you don't want to be you?

JERRY: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?

GEORGE: Like who?

JERRY: Dylan Murphy.

(George mumbles something.)

JERRY: What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?

GEORGE: Well I like Dylan.

JERRY: You could be Colin.

GEORGE: Colin O'Brien.

JERRY: I'm Dylan Murphy.

GEORGE: I'm Colin O'Brien.

(They walk towards the chauffeur.)

GEORGE: Are we really doing this?

JERRY: Come on,

MAN: (to George) Hey, do you have the time?

GEORGE: Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.

CHAUFFEUR: Yes sir.

GEORGE: Sorry we're late.

CHAUFFEUR: Here let me take that for you.

GEORGE: Oh thank you.

CHAUFFEUR: I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.

GEORGE: Thank you very much. Dylan?

JERRY: Colin?


[George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.]

GEORGE: This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!

JERRY: She happy for you?

GEORGE: Can he hear us?

JERRY: No. Why?

GEORGE: I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.

JERRY: He can't hear us.

GEORGE: Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.

JERRY: Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?

GEORGE: We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?

CHAUFFEUR: Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.

GEORGE: Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!

JERRY: We're going to the Knick game!

GEORGE: Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!

JERRY: I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!

GEORGE: You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?

JERRY: Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.

GEORGE: If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'

JERRY: Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.

CHAUFFEUR: I know.

Jerry and GEORGE: He knows?

GEORGE: Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?

JERRY: Maybe it's a shortcut.

GEORGE: We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.

JERRY: (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?

CHAUFFEUR: Pick up the other members of your party.

GEORGE: Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.

JERRY: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.

GEORGE: It was a good jig.

JERRY: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.

GEORGE: There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.

JERRY: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.

GEORGE: Well you should have been O'Brien.

JERRY: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?

GEORGE: Yes, you have to be Murphy.

JERRY: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.

GEORGE: You're Murphy!

JERRY: I'm Seinfeld!

GEORGE: You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.

JERRY: We're doing sixty miles an hour!

GEORGE: So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.

JERRY: Who are you, Mannix?

GEORGE: We're slowing down. Are those the people?

JERRY: Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.

(The limo pulls over, two people, a man (Tim) and a woman (Eva), get in.)

WOMAN: (reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?

JERRY: No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.

EVA: (whispering) Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.

JERRY: Newsletter?

TIM: And of course, his great book, "The Game".

JERRY: Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?

EVA: No.

JERRY: Never seen a picture of him?

EVA: Never.

JERRY: Not even on the book jacket?

EVA: There was no picture on the book jacket.

JERRY: (nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.

GEORGE: Hello. I'm O'Brien.


[Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner.]

KRAMER: Hey!

ELAINE: Hey!

KRAMER: What, you took a cab?

ELAINE: Yeah? So?

KRAMER: How much do you make?

ELAINE: I'm not telling you.

KRAMER: C'mon.

ELAINE: No!

KRAMER: I'll tell you how much I make.

ELAINE: I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.

KRAMER: You ever seen Michael Jordan?

ELAINE: Just in those commercials.

KRAMER: Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.

ELAINE: What's that?

KRAMER: Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.

ELAINE: Huh?

KRAMER: Yeah.

(Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of garbage cans.)


[Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.]

JERRY: (checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.

TIM: You think someone's been tipped off?

GEORGE: So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?

EVA: (fawning) Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.

GEORGE: Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".

EVA: Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.

GEORGE: Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.

TIM: Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.

GEORGE: Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.

JERRY: He tends to exaggerate.

GEORGE: Okay, I mean it's serious but--

EVA: We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.

GEORGE: Uh, my speech?

EVA: Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?

JERRY: Well you might as well look it over.


[Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.]

KRAMER: So what's going on, how did all this happen?

ELAINE: Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

KRAMER: Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.

ELAINE: He did.

KRAMER: Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?

ELAINE: I don't know.

KRAMER: That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?

ELAINE: Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.

KRAMER: O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?


[Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.]

GEORGE: ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.

JERRY: You're not going to open with that, are you?

EVA: What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?

GEORGE: I said so many things.

(Suddenly they hear a loud bang.)

GEORGE: They're shooting! They're shooting!

TIM: (pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!

(The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, Eva has fallen on top of George.)

EVA. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.

GEORGE: That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.

EVA: But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.

(Tim returns.)

TIM: Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.

Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling it sensually.

JERRY: Nice looking Lugar.

JODI: I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.


[Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.]

KRAMER: Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?

(A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized Elaine.)

DAN: Elaine?

ELAINE: Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?

DAN: Good.

ELAINE: Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.

DAN: Oh, Kramer?

(They shake hands.)

ELAINE: What's going on?

DAN: Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.

ELAINE: Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

DAN: Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.

ELAINE: Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.

DAN: Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.

KRAMER: Who?

DAN: The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.


[Cut back to the limo.]

(Jerry and George are alone inside.)

JERRY: What's taking him so long out there?

GEORGE: Didja see the way she was looking at me?

JERRY: She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!

GEORGE: I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.

JERRY: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Let's just make a run for it.

GEORGE: I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.

JERRY: How'd that happen?

GEORGE: I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.

JERRY: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.

GEORGE: For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.

(George grabs the phone and dials.)

GEORGE: 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--

(Tim re-enters the limo.)

GEORGE: --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.

TIM: We'll be ready in a minute.

GEORGE: Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.

TIM: With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.

GEORGE: Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?

TIM: You are.

GEORGE: And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?

TIM: You are.

GEORGE: Good. I think you forgot something.

TIM: I'm sorry.

GEORGE: Good. Now get out.

(Tim leaves.)

GEORGE: Okay, what are we gonna do?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.

JERRY: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.


[Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.]

KRAMER: I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.

ELAINE: I'm sure he was just joking around.

KRAMER: Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!

ELAINE: What is it?

KRAMER: Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!

ELAINE: Jerry's a nazi?!

KRAMER: I can't believe I didn't see it.

ELAINE: Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.

KRAMER: You don't think so.

ELAINE: No, he's just neat.


[Cut back to the limo]

TIM: You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.

GEORGE: Me??

(George and Jerry laugh nervously.)

TIM: And you really don't look like a Murphy.

JERRY: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.

GEORGE: He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.

TIM: Where are you from?

JERRY: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.

TIM: Sounds more like Scottish.

JERRY: We were right on the border.


[Cut back to the street corner]

KRAMER: Maybe he's with the company.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.

ELAINE: What about his comedy act?

KRAMER: That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.

ELAINE: What about George?

KRAMER: What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!

ELAINE: I'll bet they were even in on it.

KRAMER: Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.

ELAINE: Kramer, you're hurting me!


[Quick cut to the now approaching limo.]

GEORGE: Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.

ELAINE: Get off of me!!

(The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.)

KRAMER: O'Brien.

(This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby bus stop.)

MAN #1: O'Brien? Is that him?

MAN #2: Yeah, that's him.

MAN #3: Look there's O'Brien!

MAN #4: Filthy nazi bastard!

ALL FOUR MEN: Let's get him!!

(They begin running full speed towards the gang.)

GEORGE: What do I do?! What do I do?!

JERRY: Get in the car! Get in the car!

(George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.)

KRAMER: (pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?

TIM: Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?

JERRY: No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.

ELAINE: It could be very confusing.

(The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.)

KRAMER: Yeah? Eva?

EVA: It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.

KRAMER: O'Brien? Well that's weird.

EVA: (gun drawn) Who are you?

(George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car broke down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.)


[Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.]

JODI: A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.


[Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three are intelligible at this point.]

JODI: They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.

Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming unnerved.

EVA: Get out!!

ELAINE: Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!

DAN: Elaine?

ELAINE: Hey!


[Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.]

GEORGE: I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!


[Closing monologue]

So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie and there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they would do and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil, remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how are ya, is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the copier? Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, nice to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?

[Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at home in her bed]

ELAINE: You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?

JERRY: It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.

(Driver cuts in front of Jerry)

JERRY: Oh look at this guy.

ELAINE: What's goin' on?

JERRY: Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.

ELAINE: Did you get a thank you wave?

JERRY: No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?

(Jerry sticks his head out the window)

JERRY: Give me that wave!

ELAINE: Jerry, are you free on Friday?

JERRY: Yeah, I'm free, why?

ELAINE: Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.

JERRY: Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!

ELAINE: You gotta follow that car!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: You can't let him get away with that!

JERRY: Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.

ELAINE: What are you, yellow?

JERRY: I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)

ELAINE: Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.

JERRY: Wait, he stopped, he's parking.

ELAINE: What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?


[Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront other driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman]

JERRY: Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.

(They both smile flirtatiously at each other)


[Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are talking by the table]

JERRY: So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.

GEORGE: Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.

JERRY: You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.

(Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate)

JERRY: He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)

GEORGE: I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?

JERRY: Let's not even analyze it.

(Jerry begins walking towards door)

GEORGE: So you didn't turn her in?

JERRY: I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.

GEORGE: Gonna see her again?

JERRY: Friday night.

(Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button)

JERRY: Yep.

ELAINE: It's me!

JERRY: Come on up.

(Jerry unlocks and opens door)

JERRY: By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.

GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! I dig.

(George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups)

JERRY: Oh, you dig?

GEORGE: Yes! I see enormous potential here.

JERRY: Why?

(George pours two cups of milk)

GEORGE: Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.

JERRY: I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.

GEORGE: I don't think so.

JERRY: Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!

(Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent)

JERRY: On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!

(Jerry looks at his cup in disgust)

JERRY: What am I drinking, milk?

(Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket)

ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hi.

(Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry)

ELAINE: Sweater.

JERRY: Thank you.

ELAINE: So? What happened?

(Jerry starts walking away)

JERRY: With that?

ELAINE: With the car!

JERRY: What car?

ELAINE: The hit and run!

JERRY: Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.

ELAINE: Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?

JERRY: Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)

(George walks out of the kitchen)

GEORGE: Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.

JERRY: Yeah, Queens.

ELAINE: So? Then what?

JERRY: So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"

(Elaine gasps)

JERRY: So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."

(Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement)

ELAINE: I am speechless. I am without speech.

GEORGE: Tell her about the shoving.

JERRY: What?

(George smiles pointing at him)

ELAINE: What shoving?!

JERRY: Oh, it was nothing.

GEORGE: No! Tell her.

(Jerry looks at George with a grin)
JERRY: Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)

ELAINE: You know karate??

JERRY: I know a little.

ELAINE: Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?

JERRY: He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey! (Group does likewise)

ELAINE: Did you tell Kramer?

JERRY: Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)

KRAMER: What? What? What? Tell me.

ELAINE: Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.

(Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling)

KRAMER: Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)

KRAMER: They should be sent to Australia.

(Jerry has a confused look)

JERRY: Australia?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.

JERRY: But not anymore.

KRAMER: No.

(Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer)

ELAINE: Hey Kramer, Kramer!

KRAMER: Yeah?

ELAINE: What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)

KRAMER: I don't know!

(Jerry smiles and shakes his head)

KRAMER: You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.

(Elaine has a look of surprise)

ELAINE: Well, that is, that is strange.

KRAMER: Yep. (Mumbles off)

(Elaine walks toward door)

ELAINE: Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?

JERRY: Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.

(Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry)

ELAINE: But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)

JERRY: We just met.

(Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger)

KRAMER: Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.

ELAINE: But I, I can't go alone!

JERRY: Ask George to go with you.

ELAINE: George, come on! I'll pay for you.

GEORGE: You'll pay? I'm there.

JERRY: Why do you even need anybody?

ELAINE: Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)


[Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married couple,]

Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused on eating his meal)

ROBIN: You went out with a bullfighter?

ELAINE: Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.

MICHAEL: Wow.

ROBIN: What was his name?

ELAINE: His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.

(George points across the table)

GEORGE: Pass the salt please.

ROBIN: Where did you meet him?

ELAINE: Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.

(Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread)

GEORGE: Bread.

(Elaine hands bread to George)

ELAINE: I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.

(Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and looks at Michael)

GEORGE: God bless you.

(Robin smiles)

ROBIN: Thank you.

GEORGE: I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)

(Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)


[Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman are both eating an ice cream cones]

WOMAN: You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.

JERRY: Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.

WOMAN: Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

JERRY: Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.

(Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling)

WOMAN: Come here. (moves in for a kiss)


[Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed between Michael and George]
GEORGE: Really, I was, I was only kidding around.

ROBIN: He was only joking Michael.

(Michael throws down his serviette)

MICHAEL: You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?

GEORGE: No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.

ROBIN: He was only joking Michael! Sorry.

MICHAEL: All right! Take his side!

ROBIN: I am not taking his side.

MICHAEL: Well who's side are you taking?!

ROBIN: Well I'm not taking your side!

(Robin sneezes, George gestures to Michael that the floor is his)


[Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run woman are now kissing]

JERRY: Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.

(Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)


[Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment with George talking outside Jerry's room]

GEORGE: I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?

JERRY: The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.

(George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks over and presses the button)

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen)

GEORGE: Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.

JERRY: No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.

GEORGE: Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.

JERRY: What if she's having an off night?

(Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa)

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hi.

(Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen)

ELAINE: Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!

(George walks out of kitchen)

GEORGE: Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.

(Jerry sneezes)

GEORGE: Ah, shut up.

ELAINE: What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.

(Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa)

JERRY: A stupid what?

(Elaine looks at Jerry)

ELAINE: Whatever.

JERRY: You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.

(Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes)

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.

GEORGE: Who?

ELAINE: Robin!

(George looks quickly at Elaine)

GEORGE: Why?!

ELAINE: Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.

(George stands up)

JERRY: Entertainment Tonight's on.

GEORGE: Where's the remote phone?

JERRY: Bedroom.

(George walks toward Jerry's bedroom)

ELAINE: Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?

(Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and Elaine, then walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice of Mary Hart starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the sofa.)

JERRY: What's it like out?

(Kramer continues to shake behind sofa)

ELAINE: Chilly out.

JERRY: Can I take a sweater?

ELAINE: Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.

JERRY: Scarf?

ELAINE: Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.

(Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes)

JERRY: What's the matter? What's going on?

(Kramer is looking around like he's lost)

KRAMER: What happened?!

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: I think I hit my head again!

JERRY: What is wrong?!

(Elaine is pointing at the TV)

ELAINE: Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?

KRAMER: Yeah.

(Elaine claps her hands together then stands up)

ELAINE: That is it!

KRAMER: What?

(Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him)

ELAINE: That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!

(George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits down)

KRAMER: Mary Hart!

GEORGE: God.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.

JERRY: Get together?

GEORGE: Maybe she just wants to talk to me?

ELAINE: Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.

(George walks to other side of sofa)

GEORGE: Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.

(George sits on chair)

ELAINE: Are you actually considering this?

GEORGE: I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!

ELAINE: Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.

(Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable)

JERRY: Yeah.

(Kramer walks out of washroom)

KRAMER: Hey, you know who owns that car?

JERRY: What car?

KRAMER: The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.

JERRY: Yeah who?

KRAMER: That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.

(Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen)

JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.

(Elaine nods, smiling)

ELAINE: Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.

(Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows)

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?

(Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very excited)

JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants!

GEORGE: Well, who is she?

JERRY: I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.

GEORGE: Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.

(Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)

JERRY: Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!

(Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)

GEORGE: You can't compromise your principles!

JERRY: How am I going to live with myself?!

GEORGE: Can't live!

JERRY: I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!

GEORGE: This country needs more people like you!

JERRY: Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.

GEORGE: I believe strongly in that as you know.

JERRY: There should be more people like us.

GEORGE: That's why the world's in the shape it's in.

JERRY: You're telling me.

(Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading their magazines)


[Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking to the girl with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door]

JERRY: Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.

(Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling)

BECKY: Well God bless you.

(Jerry pauses)

JERRY: Thank you very much.


[Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are together in bed]

GEORGE: Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?

ROBIN: Oh no, what's wrong?

GEORGE: What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!

ROBIN: You didn't commit adultery, I did.

GEORGE: Oh yeah.

ROBIN: If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.

GEORGE: Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.

ROBIN: Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.

GEORGE: Well, that's a given.

ROBIN: In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.

GEORGE: Must be hell living in that house.


[Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the phone to Michael]

MICHAEL: Hi, it's Michael.

ELAINE: Hi, Michael!

MICHAEL: Is Robin there?

ELAINE: Robin? No, why?

MICHAEL: Uh, she said she was going to be with you.

ELAINE: No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.

(Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)

MICHAEL: If she's not with you, then where is she?

ELAINE: Well I, I don't know.

MICHAEL: Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!

ELAINE: No, no, come on Michael!

MICHAEL: He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!

(Michael sneezes)

ELAINE: You're soo good lookin'.


[Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela are talking by the sofa]

ANGELA: Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!

JERRY: Let me rephra-

ANGELA: I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!

(Elaine walks in)

JERRY: Hi Elaine, this is Angela.

ANGELA: I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!

(Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen)

JERRY: Well I think I get the gist of it.

ANGELA: So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!

(Jerry shrugs)

JERRY: What car?

(Jerry hands Angela her purse)

ANGELA: Good. I'm glad we understand each other.

JERRY: It's not complicated.

(Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves)

ELAINE: Very nice meeting you!

(Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)

ELAINE: Come on up.

(Elaine laughs)

ELAINE: Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.

JERRY: Alright Elaine.

ELAINE: No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!

JERRY: It was just a couple of blocks.

(Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter)

ELAINE: Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!

(George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward him, Jerry goes to washroom)

GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Oh, did you check you machine?

(George takes glass from cupboard)

GEORGE: No, why, what's happening?

ELAINE: Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.

GEORGE: Yeah, okay.

ELAINE: And I said I hadn't seen her.

GEORGE: What?!

ELAINE: No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.

GEORGE: He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!

ELAINE: He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.

GEORGE: What? Why couldn't you think of something?!

ELAINE: Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!

GEORGE: You lie! How hard is it to lie?!

(Jerry walks back from washroom)

JERRY: It's not that hard.

(Elaine points finger at George)

ELAINE: Well who told you to sleep with her George?!

GEORGE: It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!

ELAINE: Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!

GEORGE: Oh don't-

(Jerry raises his arms)

JERRY: Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?

GEORGE: She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.

JERRY: A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?

ELAINE: Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.

(Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador)

JERRY: Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!


[Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to her outside her door)

JERRY: Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.

BECKY: Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.

JERRY: $875?

BECKY: That's right.

JERRY: Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.

(Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing)

JERRY: Um, who do I make it out to?

BECKY: Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

JERRY: So, what are you doing this weekend?

(Jerry hands check to Becky)

BECKY: You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?

JERRY: I didn't do it!

BECKY: Yeah righ-

(Becky sneezes)

JERRY: You are soo good lookin'.

(Becky closes door)

BECKY: Thank you.


[Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in bedroom and George is looking out window]

GEORGE: Jerry, let's go! You ready?

(Jerry walks out of bedroom)

JERRY: You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!

GEORGE: Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.

JERRY: Alright!

(George put his bag over his shoulder)

GEORGE: Come on let's get out of here.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: How could you?

JERRY: What?!

KRAMER: Man! I never thought you were capable of this!

JERRY: What did I do?

KRAMER: I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.

JERRY: I-

KRAMER: I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.

JERRY: I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!

KRAMER: Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?

(Jerry is putting on sweater)

JERRY: No, never.

KRAMER: Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.

JERRY: You got a date with Becky Gelke?!

KRAMER: Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.

GEORGE: Jerry, can we get out of here?!

KRAMER: As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.

JERRY: Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.

(Jerry yanks coat out of George's hands)


[Scene moves to outside Becky's apartment. Kramer is walking toward her door, hair slicked back, with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. He knocks on her door, she opens. Mary Hart's voice is playing on the TV in the distance. Kramer starts having a violent seizure.]

(Nina’s art studio. Kramer is posing for Nina (Jerry’s current girlfriend.)

NINA: (laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I can’t do this if you keep moving.

KRAMER: You sure you don’t want me to take my clothes off? (beat) I’ll do it!

NINA: No, that’s the last thing in the world I want you to do.

KRAMER: Well, why don’t you take your clothes off?

NINA: I don’t know... I don’t think Jerry would like that.

KRAMER: (debonair smile) Well, it’d be our little secret.


[CUT TO: Jerry’s apartment]

GEORGE: (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!

JERRY: I like the button fly.

GEORGE: (incredulous) What?

JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It’s like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?

GEORGE: I don’t get art.

JERRY: There’s nothing to get.

GEORGE: Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.

JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.

GEORGE: What for?

JERRY: She sees something in him.

GEORGE: So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.


[CUT TO: Nina's studio again--same scene]

KRAMER: Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.

NINA: Tell me about Elaine.

KRAMER: She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

NINA: But, they're still friends.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).

NINA: Don't you think that's strange?

KRAMER: Why, what's the difference?

NINA: Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?

KRAMER: Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.


[CUT TO: the door outside Nina's studio]

GEORGE: You know, I'm a little nervous.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.

JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.

GEORGE: Really? I thought you liked her.

JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)

GEORGE: You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?

(Nina opens the door)

JERRY: Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.

NINA: How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)

JERRY: (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.

NINA: Oh, are you interested?

GEORGE: (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.

KRAMER: George, you gonna buy a painting?

GEORGE: (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.

NINA: Are you an art-lover?

GEORGE: I am an art-adorer! I adore art.

NINA: Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)

JERRY: May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)

NINA: (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)

JERRY: What's this?

NINA: My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.

JERRY: (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.

NINA: Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?

KRAMER: (immediately) Yeah.

JERRY: They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!

GEORGE: Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?

NINA: Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.

GEORGE: All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!

NINA: (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?


[CUT TO: Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead to their seats]

GEORGE: Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?

USHER: No, no, these are your seats.

GEORGE: She said first row! Right behind the dugout!

ELAINE: Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.

GEORGE: I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!

ELAINE: Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.

GEORGE: Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.

KRAMER: Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!

ELAINE: I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.

GEORGE: (amused) You're supposed to do that?

ELAINE: (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?

GEORGE: I'd rather go to a hanging.

ELAINE: Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)

KRAMER: (screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,

JOHNNY, 'CAUSE THIS AIN'T PHILIDELPHIA!!

(a man approaches the trio)

MAN: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

MAN: Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.

GEORGE: Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--

ELAINE: Hi!

KRAMER: (screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!

GEORGE: --and this is Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh, hey.

(the Yankees make a good play, the crowd applauds)

WEST: So how are the seats?

GEORGE: Okay.

ELAINE: Great, great.

KRAMER: Yeah.

WEST: George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.

GEORGE: Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?

WEST: Well, if you have a lot of money.

(Yankees make a horrible play, the crowd responds)

WEST: (leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap.

ELAINE: (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!

WEST: No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.

ELAINE: You're not serious.

WEST: Yes, yes, yes, I am!

ELAINE: Well, did he say that?

WEST: No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.

ELAINE: Well maybe you should ask him!

WEST: I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?

ELAINE: No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!

GEORGE: Just take the cap off.

ELAINE: George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!

WEST: Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.

ELAINE: Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.

GEORGE: Just take the cap off!

ELAINE: No!

(a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking off

GEORGE'S hat, and throwing it onto the field... West calls security over, they proceed to remove Elaine)

KRAMER: Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!

GEORGE: (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?

KRAMER: (getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.

ELAINE: (sarcastically, to George) Stay!

GEORGE: Okay, we'll go!

(meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's cap... the camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where Kramer is: the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto the crowd)

[END OF ACT 1]


[ACT 2]

(Jerry's apartment--day)

ELAINE: ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!

JERRY: Is he okay?

ELAINE: Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!

JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!

ELAINE: I know! Can you imagine that?

(Kramer enters with a bandage wrapper around his forehead)

JERRY: How you feeling?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.

ELAINE: Wha- a picture?

KRAMER: A picture.

ELAINE: OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??

KRAMER: Uh-huh.

(they all crowd around, looking at the picture)

ELAINE: (gasps) I cannot believe this!

JERRY: (pointing) There's George!

KRAMER: Yup, yup!

ELAINE: Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!


[CUT TO: Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.]

ELAINE: Hi, Mr. Lippman.

LIPPMAN:How's your father?

ELAINE: My, my father?

LIPPMAN:Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?

ELAINE: Yeah.

LIPPMAN:Uh-huh.

ELAINE: I went to visit him.

LIPPMAN:Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?

ELAINE: Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...

LIPPMAN:But--but he's feeling better now?

ELAINE: Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.

LIPPMAN:(correcting her) Boo-eed.

ELAINE: What--what did I say?

LIPPMAN:You said "boyed."

ELAINE: I did?

LIPPMAN:Yeah.

(Elaine starts to laugh hysterically, and at the same time discreetly removes Lippman's sports section from his desk. She manages to maneuver it into her lap, out of sight.)

LIPPMAN:Well, I got a plane to catch.

ELAINE: Oh! Where are you going?

LIPPMAN:Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?

ELAINE: Ah. ...Yeah.

LIPPMAN:I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.

ELAINE: There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...

LIPPMAN:Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?

ELAINE: Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)

LIPPMAN:Gotta go.

ELAINE: Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!


[CUT TO: Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's "Kramer."]

MRS.ARM:I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.

MR. ARM:I see a parasite.

MRS.ARM:A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.


[CUT TO: Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.]

NINA: She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.

JERRY: It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?


[CUT TO: Armstrongs admiring painting again.]

MRS.ARM:He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!

MR. ARM:He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.


[CUT TO: Jerry and Nina again.]

JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.

NINA: Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!

JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!

NINA: Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!


[CUT TO: Armstrongs]

MRS.ARM:He transcends time and space.

MR. ARM:He sickens me.

MRS.ARM:I love it.

MR. ARM:Me too.


[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment.]

GEORGE: Five-hundred dollars?! What?

JERRY: That's what she told me!

GEORGE: I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!

JERRY: That's what it costs!

GEORGE: Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!

JERRY: I wasn't thinking! I don't know.

GEORGE: You weren't thinking.

JERRY: Well, she framed it and everything.

GEORGE: Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?

JERRY: Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!

GEORGE: I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.

KRAMER: (entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.

GEORGE: Hey, Kramer.

KRAMER: Hi, Mike.

JERRY: (looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!

KRAMER: (notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!

JERRY: (reading note) Oh my god!

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!

GEORGE: What's it say?

JERRY: Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."

GEORGE: WOW!

KRAMER: (emotionally) She's deep.

JERRY: (reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"

(Kramer blows his noes loudly) "...because I'm sure as hell fighting for you!"

KRAMER: You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!

JERRY: No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!

KRAMER: (pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!

JERRY: Should I?

KRAMER: (screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!

JERRY: ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.


[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her coat. The TV is on a horse race.]

JERRY: SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?

GEORGE: (on intercom) It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.

NINA: What's the appeal of the posse?

JERRY: The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.

(George enters)

NINA: Hello, George.

GEORGE: Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?

NINA: Well, I really love that piece.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.

NINA: No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!

GEORGE: This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.

NINA: Honestly, George, the money's not important.

GEORGE: Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: (on intercom) It's Elaine.

JERRY: Come on up.

NINA: Elaine?

JERRY: ...Yeah.

NINA: (rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?

JERRY: She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.

GEORGE: I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: How 'bout Kramer.

JERRY: HUGE pop-in guy!

NINA: Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?

JERRY: Yeah.

NINA: Okay.

JERRY: Okay!

NINA: Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)

ELAINE: (to Nina) Hello!

(Nina doesn't respond, just walks past Elaine)

ELAINE: (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!

JERRY: If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!

ELAINE: No, he wants to torture me.


[CUT TO: later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.]

ELAINE: (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)

JERRY: (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.

ELAINE: You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.

(another tug-o-war starts)

JERRY: Let go!

ELAINE: No, come on! I want it, Jerry!

JERRY: Let go, Elaine!

ELAINE: Well at least let George do it!

JERRY: Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)

GEORGE: (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.

(George starts clicking, the first station he lands on is playing Neil Simon's Chapter 2. After a few seconds, George gets bored, and changes the station)

JERRY: Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)

ELAINE: It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.

JERRY: (on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!

ELAINE: What letter?

JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!

(Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, and starts reading in unison with movie on TV.)

JERRY: "...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"

GEORGE: This is incredible!

JERRY: I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!

GEORGE: Maybe I won't send her that check.

ELAINE: You know, it's not really that terrible.

JERRY: What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!


[CUT TO: Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room]

LIPPMAN:(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?

ELAINE: Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.

LIPPMAN:Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?

ELAINE: Well, uh, fan. My father--

LIPPMAN:Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!

ELAINE: Really?

LIPPMAN:Yeah.

ELAINE: So... impudent.

LIPPMAN:Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.

ELAINE: (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--

LIPPMAN:Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.

ELAINE: (very reluctant) Okay.

LIPPMAN:Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.

ELAINE: That will be fun.


[CUT TO: Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her, sitting on the sofa.]

JERRY: How's it coming?

NINA: Good, good.

JERRY: Seen any good movies lately?

NINA: No... not really. You?

JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?

NINA: Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.

JERRY: I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?

NINA: I don't know... maybe.

JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)

MR. ARM:Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."


[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball game and talking.]

GEORGE: Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)

JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!

GEORGE: So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?

JERRY: Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?

GEORGE: Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.

(the Yankees announcer is heard on TV)

TVVOICE: Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.

GEORGE: Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.

TVVOICE: Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."

(Jerry and George look at each other, wondering.)


[CUT TO: the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having Kramer over for dinner.]

KRAMER: ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.

MRS.ARM: More potatoes?

KRAMER: Yeah, sure. Please.

MR. ARM:Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?

KRAMER: Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.

At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in there."


[Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.

JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.

KRAMER: Well, where is it?

JERRY: What's the difference?

KRAMER: Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.

JERRY: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?

KRAMER: What happened to the car?

JERRY: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.

JERRY: You have to know, you must know.

KRAMER: I must know.

JERRY: Well, I'm not telling you.

KRAMER: Oh, come on.

JERRY: Nope. I don't think so.

KRAMER: Well, please?

JERRY: Not today, pal.

KRAMER: Okay, I beg you.

JERRY: Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.

KRAMER: Okay, please! Please tell me!

JERRY: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.

KRAMER: Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.

JERRY: I loaned the car to George.

KRAMER: Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?

JERRY: George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!

KRAMER: Alright.

JERRY: Huh?

KRAMER: Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?

JERRY: Will you stop it already?!

KRAMER: You know, why didn't they ask me to go?

JERRY: I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!

KRAMER: What, they don't like me?

JERRY: *I* don't like you!

KRAMER: If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.



[George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.]

GEORGE: I really think it looks good.

ELAINE: Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?

GEORGE: All bald people look good in hats.

ELAINE: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.

GEORGE: What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.

ELAINE: Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?

GEORGE: No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.

ELAINE: Are you sure you like these sunglasses?

Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this causes George to swerve and hit something.


[Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.]

KRAMER: Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?

JERRY: Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.

(Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.)

KRAMER: Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?

JERRY: No, I like Mike.

KRAMER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.

JERRY: Oh yeah? What did you talk about?

KRAMER: Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.

JERRY: Oh yeah? What did he say?

KRAMER: You have to know everything, don't you?

JERRY: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?

KRAMER: Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?

JERRY: Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.

KRAMER: Beg me.

JERRY: Please, don't make me beg.

KRAMER: No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.

JERRY: Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.

KRAMER: No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...

JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.

JERRY: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.

KRAMER: Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.

JERRY: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!

KRAMER: He thinks you're a phony.

JERRY: He what?

KRAMER: I told you, he thinks you're a phony.

JERRY: A phony? He called me a phony?

KRAMER: A big phone. A big one.

JERRY: Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!

KRAMER: You begged me.


[Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking noise.]

GEORGE: Do you hear that?

ELAINE: Of course I hear that.

GEORGE: You had to move the mirror?

ELAINE: I wanted to check out my sunglasses.

GEORGE: I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.

GEORGE: I can't drive?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.

ELAINE: No, I really don't.

GEORGE: And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.

ELAINE: I'm sure you could.

GEORGE: What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?

ELAINE: I don't know.

GEORGE: Alright, start looking for spaces.

ELAINE: Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.

GEORGE: Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.

ELAINE: Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.

GEORGE: I can't park in a garage.

ELAINE: Why?

GEORGE: I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.

ELAINE: I'll pay for it.

GEORGE: You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.

ELAINE: (pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!

GEORGE: (putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?

ELAINE: You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.

(They share a laugh.)

GEORGE: Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.

ELAINE: Will you just park it already?

GEORGE: There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!

ELAINE: George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.

GEORGE: No no no, he's not getting away with this.

ELAINE: George?

(George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.)

GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing?

MIKE: I think I'm parking my car.

GEORGE: You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.

MIKE: I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.

GEORGE: Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?

MIKE: Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.

GEORGE: I was in the middle of a conversation.

MIKE: Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

GEORGE: The point is I was here first.

MIKE: I was closer to this space than you were.

GEORGE: But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!

MIKE: I can if I have room!

GEORGE: Are you gonna move the car?

MIKE: No, I'm not gonna move the car.

GEORGE: Jerk!

MIKE: Oh, you're not?

GEORGE: Do you believe this guy?

ELAINE: Come on, we'll put it in a garage.

GEORGE: I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.

ELAINE: What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.

GEORGE: Are you coming back down?

ELAINE: Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?

ELAINE: Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.

GEORGE: Oh, come on, you're good at this.

ELAINE: What am I gonna say?

GEORGE: I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.

(Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.)


[Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.]

ELAINE: Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?

JERRY: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?

ELAINE: Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)

JERRY: (bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.

ELAINE: (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.

JERRY: He is?

ELAINE: Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.

JERRY: A gun?!

ELAINE: I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.

JERRY: My god, are you okay?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.

JERRY: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.

ELAINE: Exactly.

JERRY: Where's George now?

ELAINE: Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: Look out the window, you'll see.

JERRY: (leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!

GEORGE: Hey!

JERRY: Are you okay?

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm fine.

JERRY: Crazy kids, huh?

GEORGE: What?

ELAINE: (desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.

MIKE: Is that Jerry? Jerry?!

JERRY: Oh, hey Mike.

GEORGE: What, you know Jerry?

MIKE: Yeah, I know Jerry.

GEORGE: How do you know him?

MIKE: What's the difference?

GEORGE: Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.

MIKE: Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!

JERRY: I'm coming down.

MIKE: Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?

GEORGE: What, you know Kramer?!

(Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.)

ELAINE: Hi.

KRAMER: (acting standoffish) Hello.

JERRY: Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.

KRAMER: (out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!

GEORGE: And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?

MIKE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh great.

ELAINE: You know that guy downstairs?

JERRY: Yeah, he's a real phony.

KRAMER: What's going on?!

MIKE: Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!

GEORGE: It's my space!

KRAMER: I'll be down in a minute.

ELAINE: Are you going down?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Is anything wrong?

KRAMER: (leaving) Why should anything be wrong?

ELAINE: (heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.

(Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.)

MIKE: Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.

GEORGE: I'll die out here.

(Two bystanders are discussing the incident. )

BYSTANDER #1: He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.

BYSTANDER #2: No, it doesn't matter. He was-

MIKE: Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!

JERRY: Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.

MIKE: Hey Krame! You know this guy?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know him.

MIKE: (to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?

JERRY: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.

MIKE: (laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!

GEORGE: Oh, come on.

MIKE: Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.

GEORGE: Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?

MIKE: Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.

GEORGE: You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!

MIKE: I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!

GEORGE: You've got a prayer.

KRAMER: I go in front first all the time.

JERRY: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.

(Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.)

GEORGE: Did you talk to him?

ELAINE: Yeah, it's all taken care of.

GEORGE: You told him? What did you tell him?

ELAINE: I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.

GEORGE: I don't believe it, what did you say?

ELAINE: I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.

GEORGE: A pack of teenagers?

ELAINE: Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.

GEORGE: You are a genius, it's as simple as that.

ELAINE: What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.

(Elaine and George rejoin the others.)

KRAMER: By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.

GEORGE: Oh great.

JERRY: I didn't know.

ELAINE: Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.

GEORGE: Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.

MIKE: A flea market? You went to a flea market??

GEORGE: Hey, who's talking to you?

ELAINE: We just didn't think of you.

KRAMER: You said it, sister.

GEORGE: What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?

(People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.)

GEORGE: Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.

JERRY: I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!

GEORGE: Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.

JERRY: You're right. My fault.

ELAINE: Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm sorry.

KRAMER: I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.

GEORGE: What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?

JERRY: It was a so-so sorry.

(A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.)

TRUCK DRIVER: Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!

GEORGE: You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.

MIKE: And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?

TRUCK DRIVER: Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!

ELAINE: You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.

JERRY: Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.

ELAINE: Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?

GEORGE: Uh huh.

JERRY: Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,

GEORGE: Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.

ELAINE: Right.

GEORGE: I learned a lot about myself.

JERRY: What did you do to my car?!

GEORGE: I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.

ELAINE: Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.

JERRY: I thought you said you were a good driver!

GEORGE: No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.

JERRY: I think you said driver.

GEORGE: Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.

MIKE: Will you move it up a little bit?

GEORGE: No no no, that's in the right position.

MIKE: No no, I was further in.

GEORGE: No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.

MIKE: Do you mind?

GEORGE: Do you?

SID: Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.

JERRY: Hey Sid.

MIKE: Who are you?

SID: Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?

GEORGE: Sid, it's completely his fault.

MIKE: Oh, right.

SID: Why don't you start taking the bus?

JERRY: Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.

GEORGE: Don't do it!

JERRY: What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?

GEORGE: Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.

ELAINE: Why don't you just flip a coin already?

GEORGE: No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.

ELAINE: You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.

GEORGE: So you're against me now?

(An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt store, are discussing the incident.)

ANGRY MAN: He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.

MATTHEW: No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.

ANGRY MAN: No he wasn't.

MATTHEW: All that matters is who was there first.

ANGRY MAN: Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.

MATTHEW: You just spit on me!

ANGRY MAN: Don't you raise your voice to me!

MATTHEW: You're not my father.

JERRY: Hey Matthew.

MATTHEW: Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.

JERRY: How ya doing?

MATTHEW: Okay.

JERRY: Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.

MATTHEW: What?!

JERRY: Oh no, nothing.

MATTHEW: What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?

JERRY: No, no, no, no.

MATTHEW: We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?

JERRY: No, of course not, of course not!

MATTHEW: Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?

MARYEDITH: Jerry?! What's the matter with you?

JERRY: I didn't--

MARYEDITH: (to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.

KRAMER: Oh, congratulations.

MARYEDITH: What for?

KRAMER: Well, you're pregnant.

MARYEDITH: What?

KRAMER: You're not pregnant?

MARYEDITH: No, I'm not pregnant.

KRAMER: Are you sure you're not pregnant?

MARYEDITH: Yes, I'm sure!

KRAMER: That's weird.

MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew.

MATTHEW: No.

MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew!

KRAMER: I thought she was pregnant.

JERRY: (to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Mike thinks I'm a phony.

ELAINE: He thinks you're a phony?

JERRY: Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.

ELAINE: Oh, you have to say something.

JERRY: I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.

ELAINE: You gotta open the vault.

JERRY: Open my vault?

ELAINE: Open your vault.

JERRY: Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.

ELAINE: You have no choice.

JERRY: Oy ga-vault.

Newman: (to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.

(George begins applauding.)

KRAMER: When can you park head first?

NEWMAN: Never.

MIKE: What are you asking this guy for?

NEWMAN: Who's talking to you?

GEORGE: He's right. never.

MIKE: Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?

NEWMAN: Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.

GEORGE: When do you ever have ten car lengths?

KRAMER: What about Sundays and holidays?

GEORGE: Oh please.

(A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George)

SHEILA: What's going on here?

GEORGE: Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.

SHEILA: I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.

GEORGE: Well, thank you for your support.

SHEILA: Hey, that's a great hat.

GEORGE: Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.

NEWMAN: Hey George, nice hat.

GEORGE: Yeah, thanks.

NEWMAN: Can I try it on?

GEORGE: No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.

NEWMAN: Well sure it would.

GEORGE: No! Get out of here, Newman.

NEWMAN: Come on, let me try it on.

GEORGE: No, Newman, stop it.

SHEILA: Let him try it on.

GEORGE: I don't want him to!

SHEILA: What is wrong with you?

GEORGE: You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!

NEWMAN: Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.

GEORGE: Alright, just keep the hat!

JERRY: Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?

ELAINE: It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?

KRAMER: I'm not going if he's going.

NEWMAN: Me either.

GEORGE: I'm not going if he's going.

MIKE: Well I'm going.

JERRY: Well if he's going then I'm not going.

NEWMAN: But it's your house.

JERRY: I still don't have to go.

ELAINE: Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.

MIKE: Why won't you go if I go?

JERRY: Why? I'll tell you why.

KRAMER: No. Don't, Jerry.

JERRY: Like you didn't call me a phony?

MIKE: What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.

JERRY: Use it in a sentence.

MIKE: Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?

KRAMER: He begged me.

MIKE: He begged you?!

JERRY: Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?

(Two police officers walk up.)

COP #1: Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.

GEORGE: Officer, could I just explain something to you?

COP #1: Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.

GEORGE: Officer, he can't pull in head first.

MIKE: Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
sitting there.

COP #1: Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head
first.

COP #2: Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there.

COP #1: What are you talking about? This guy was here first.

COP #2: But he didn't take it.

COP #1: Hey, it's his space.

COP #2: No, it's his space.


[Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard arguing through the window]

GEORGE: Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!

MIKE: Well, you're gonna have to go to work!

GEORGE: I don't have a job!

MIKE: Neither do I!

(Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote and turns on the TV.)

REFEREE: Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*

(Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.)


[Closing monologue]

People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they think, 'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' I think because everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's like Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem is car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year, they're not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working on. Wouldn't that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving turntable, and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.

Jerry's stand-up: So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."

Opening scene: Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.

JERRY's brain: What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.

(Jerry notices his door is open.)

JERRY's brain: What the hell...? Why is the door open?

(Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns on the light.)

JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here!?

KRAMER: Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.

JERRY: You scared me!

KRAMER: It's just me.

JERRY: That's enough!

KRAMER: Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)


[Jerry's apartment, daytime. We hear Jerry hurriedly trying to get in the door.]

JERRY (from outside the door): C'mon...c'mon...

(Jerry enters, sheds his jacket, drops his luggage and heads for the bathroom. He opens the door to find Kramer taking a bubble bath in his tub.)

JERRY: Kramer! What are you doing?!

KRAMER: What does it look like I'm doing? What?

JERRY: Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!

KRAMER: Alright, alright...

JERRY: C'mon!

KRAMER: Sorry.

JERRY: Move it! Move it! Get going!

KRAMER: My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)

JERRY (from inside the bathroom): Is that my towel?

(Kramer loses the towel in the hallway and throws it on Jerry's floor from the other side of the door.)


[Jerry's hallway at night. Jerry approaches his door with a girlfriend.]

GIRLFRIEND: I'm really happy the movie was sold out.

JERRY: Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?

GIRLFRIEND: I'm from Witchita, so...

JERRY: Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)

GIRLFRIEND: Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!

JERRY: The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)

GIRLFRIEND: That was close!

JERRY: Did you see the look on that guy's face?

GIRLFRIEND: You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)

JERRY: Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!

KRAMER: Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.

JERRY: All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.

KRAMER: Oh, come on!

JERRY: No, come on!

KRAMER: What, what, I thought you went to the movies!

JERRY: It was sold out!

KRAMER: Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?

JERRY: That's the point.

KRAMER: What point?

JERRY: Just, look, just give the keys.

KRAMER: Just give me another chance!

JERRY: Don't ask me!

KRAMER: I'm asking you!

JERRY: I'm telling you.

KRAMER: You're joking.

JERRY: I'm serious!

KRAMER: It's not going to happen again!

JERRY: Yes it will, now give me those keys!

(Jerry and Kramer begin struggling over the keys. Kramer loses his footing and falls on the floor, taking his girlfriend down with him.)

KRAMER (getting up): O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)


[Jerry's apartment, the next day. Jerry is now giving his spare keys to Elaine.]

JERRY: So put 'em in a safe place.

ELAINE: I will.

JERRY: Where?

ELAINE: I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?

JERRY: I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.

ELAINE: Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.

JERRY: I can't.

)There's a gentle knock at the door.)

ELAINE (mouths the words): Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)

JERRY: Who's there?

KRAMER (in hallway): Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...

ELAINE: Oh, I'm not, uh...

KRAMER: No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."

ELAINE: Jerry, give him the keys back.

JERRY: Elaine...

(Elaine tries to give the keys to Kramer, but Jerry won't let her. Jerry and Elaine begin struggling over the keys. Kramer breaks it up.)

KRAMER: I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.

JERRY: Take the keys.

KRAMER: I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)

JERRY: O.K.!

KRAMER: Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.

JERRY: Your spare set?

KRAMER: That's right.

JERRY: You want 'em back?

KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.

(Jerry takes a huge ring with hundreds of keys on it out of his drawer, and hands it to Kramer. Kramer begins going through them.)


[the coffee shop. Kramer is now giving the huge keyring to George.]

GEORGE: Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.

KRAMER: Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!

GEORGE: Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.

KRAMER: Well, you can get 'em back.

GEORGE: I suppose I could.

KRAMER: Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.

GEORGE: Me?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.

GEORGE: Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)

WAITRESS: Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)

KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George): Do you ever yearn?

GEORGE: Yearn? Do I yearn?

KRAMER: I yearn.

GEORGE: You yearn.

KRAMER: Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?

GEORGE: Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.

KRAMER (in disgust): Look at you.

GEORGE: Aw, Kramer, don't start...

KRAMER (moving back to the othe side of the booth): You're wasting your life.

GEORGE: I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!

KRAMER: O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: You got money?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Do you have a woman?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Do you have any prospects?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: You got anything on the horizon?

GEORGE: Uh...no.

KRAMER: Do you have any action at all?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?

GEORGE: I like to get the Daily News!

KRAMER: George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.

GEORGE: Why?

KRAMER: I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.

GEORGE: Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.

KRAMER: No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.

GEORGE: "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!

KRAMER: I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?

GEORGE: Uh, no, I'm not.

KRAMER: Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)

GEORGE: You're not really gonna go to California, are you?

KRAMER (points to his head): Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)


[Elaine's apartment at night. George is picking up his spare keys from Elaine.]

GEORGE: Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.

ELAINE: Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?

GEORGE: I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."

ELAINE: That's ridiculous.

GEORGE (shakes huge keyring): That's Kramer.

ELAINE: I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.

GEORGE: What for?

ELAINE: 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.

GEORGE: Jerry? Why?

ELAINE: 'Cause he gave me his.

GEORGE: So what?

ELAINE: So, if he has my keys, I should have his.

GEORGE: Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.

ELAINE: I just said the same thing to you.

GEORGE: What?

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?

ELAINE: Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.


[Jerry's apartment the next day.]

JERRY: Did you bring the keys?

GEORGE: Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.

JERRY: This could be an emergency!

GEORGE: You never should have taken away his keys!

JERRY: I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)

GEORGE: How'd the Mets do?

JERRY: They lost.

(Jerry and George open Kramer's door and poke their heads in.)

JERRY: Kramer?

(Newman walks up behind them.)

NEWMAN (startling them): Hello, boys.

JERRY: Hello, Newman.

NEWMAN: You lookin' for someone?

JERRY: Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!

NEWMAN: Coy? I'm not being coy.

JERRY (to George): Is he being coy?

GEORGE: Yeah, coy.

JERRY: You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?

NEWMAN (coyly): Who?

JERRY: Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!

NEWMAN: Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.

JERRY: Turn around, George.

GEORGE: Sure. (Turns around.)

NEWMAN: George?

JERRY: Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)

NEWMAN: Help! Help!

JERRY: Where's Kramer?

NEWMAN: HELP! (Elaine enters.)

ELAINE: What's going on?

(Newman grabs Elaine and hides behind her.)

NEWMAN: They're gonna beat me up!

GEORGE: No we're not.

JERRY: We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.

NEWMAN: You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.

JERRY: Bad rap?

NEWMAN: Yeah. From you.

JERRY: Me?

NEWMAN: You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.

JERRY: L.A.?


[Cut to Kramer in his car on the highway, listening to rock music. The car's engine starts to fail, then stalls. Kramer can't believe it.]


[Jerry's apartment at night]

(Jerry's at the window, George and Elaine are on the couch ).

JERRY: I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.

JERRY: Huh?

ELAINE: What...?

JERRY: No, what'd you say?

ELAINE: Nothing. I didn't say anything.

JERRY: Oh, you didn't see it.

ELAINE: Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.

JERRY: I heard you say something, there.

ELAINE: I didn't say anything.

JERRY: I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!

GEORGE: Ask her about Kramer.

JERRY: She's drunk out of her mind.


[Cut back to Kramer with his car broken down on the side of the highway. He tries to thumb a ride.]

 
Jerry approaching his apartment door. He tries to unlock it, but realizes Elaine has his keys. Jerry goes to the coffee shop to call Elaine.]

JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine): Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.

 
[Kramer's managed to hitch a ride on the back of a motorcycle.]

KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine): Hey! You ever been in an accident?

BIKER: About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)

 
[Jerry in a booth at the coffee shop waiting for George. George enters, spare keys in hand.]

JERRY (applauding): Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.

GEORGE: Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.

JERRY: Don't feel right? What are you talking about?

GEORGE: Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?

JERRY: What is the big deal?

GEORGE: Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.

JERRY: First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.

GEORGE: Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.

JERRY: Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)

GEORGE: Nope, no can do.

JERRY: George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!

GEORGE: Do you wanna fight?

JERRY: Do you wanna fight?

GEORGE: I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)

 
[Kramer's managed to hitch another ride, this time with a van full of drugged-out hippies. Kramer is telling them a story as they go down the road... ]

KRAMER: And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.

HIPPIE #1: Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.

KRAMER: Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.

HIPPIE #1: Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?

KRAMER: Oh, he's cold.

HIPPIE #1: Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!

HIPPIE #1: Hey, what's the rush, man?

KRAMER: Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.

HIPPIE #1: Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?

KRAMER: What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)

HIPPIE #2: Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)

 
[Elaine's building at night. Jerry and George approach Elaine's door, still arguing about the keys.]

JERRY: Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.

GEORGE: You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.

JERRY: What's that?

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: I heard something.

GEORGE: Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)

 
[Kramer's managed to hitch yet another ride, this time with a woman driving an eighteen-wheeler.]

KRAMER: So, how long you been drivin' this thing?

WOMAN: Goin' on four years.

KRAMER: Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.

WOMAN: Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.

KRAMER: You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.

WOMAN: You want to give it a try?

KRAMER: Really?

WOMAN: Do you know how to double-clutch?

KRAMER: Yeah.

WOMAN: Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)

 
[Jerry and George in Elaine's apartment looking for Jerry's spare keys.]

GEORGE: They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!

JERRY: Well, this is great.

GEORGE: Well, what do they look like?

JERRY: They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."

GEORGE: Well, they're obviously not here.

JERRY: Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.

GEORGE: Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!

JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk): What is this? "Murphy Brown"?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: By Elaine Benes?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?

GEORGE: Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)

JERRY: Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)

GEORGE: Gimme half!

JERRY: All right, here!

GEORGE: Why didn't she tell us?

JERRY (making fun): Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)

ELAINE: You weasels!

JERRY: What? What?

ELAINE: How dare you!

GEORGE: We hardly read anything!

JERRY: It was funny!

ELAINE: Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?

JERRY: Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...

ELAINE (grabs the papers from Jerry): Well, it's just a first draft!

JERRY: I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.

ELAINE (turning on George): Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)

GEORGE: He forced me to!

JERRY: I did not!

GEORGE: Yes you did!

ELAINE: You! Get out! Get out! Get out!

JERRY: Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!

ELAINE: Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!

JERRY: Good!

ELAINE (to George): And I want my keys back from you!

GEORGE: What, you don't want me to hold your keys?

ELAINE: No, you can't be trusted!

GEORGE: Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)

JERRY (to Elaine): And I don't want you to hold mine!

ELAINE: Good! I won't!

JERRY: Good! Don't! Are these my keys?

ELAINE: These aren't my keys!

GEORGE: Whose are these?

ELAINE: I don't know!

(Meanwhile, Kramer's finally made it to Los Angeles. He's shown roller-skating through traffic, and nearly running over some guy on a scooter.)

 
[Jerry and Elaine watching "Murphy Brown" in Jerry's apartment.]

ELAINE: I just thought I could write it.

JERRY: Is that something you want to do?

ELAINE: I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.

JERRY: Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.

ELAINE: O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.

JERRY: What did you say?

ELAINE: I didn't say anything.

JERRY: I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!

ELAINE (laughing): Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!

JERRY: Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!


[Cut to the screen of Jerry's TV.]

CANDICE BERGEN: Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.

KRAMER: Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.

CANDICE BERGEN: And you are...?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.

CANDICE BERGEN: Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.

KRAMER: Steven.

CANDICE BERGEN: Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?

KRAMER: Oh - I'm familiar with it.

CANDICE BERGEN: Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.)

(Episode ends with Kramer typing rapidly on his keyboard as he takes a bite out of a donut.)
